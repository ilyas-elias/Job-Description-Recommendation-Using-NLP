SGD 1,500 to SGD 2,000","A leader in Alzheimer’s disease research, TauRx’s mission is to discover, develop and commercialise innovative products for the diagnosis, treatment and cure of neurodegenerative diseases caused through protein aggregation.



 



From initial discovery through preclinical development to clinical trials, regulatory submission and product registration, we are harnessing world-class proprietary drug discovery platforms with the aim of halting the progression of Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases with innovative treatments and diagnostics.



 



The company’s novel tau aggregation inhibitors (TAIs) target the formation (aggregation) of tau protein ‘tangles’ in the brain. The spread of tau tangles – the main driver in Alzheimer’s disease – is strongly correlated with dementia and they can develop in the brain up to 20 years before symptoms associated with dementia develop. TAIs work by dissolving existing tau aggregates and preventing the further aggregation of tau protein from forming new tangles.



 



Our lead compound, LMTX®, inhibits aggregation of tau, synuclein, TPD-43 and huntingtin proteins. Patented as a novel chemical entity and chemically distinct from TauRx’s initial research compound, rember®, LMTX® has shown promise for slowing disease progression in Alzheimer’s disease and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia.



 



Three LMTX® Phase 3 clinical trials, conducted in over 20 countries and involving over 1,900 patients, have recently completed. For a summary of the programme and study results, please follow this link.
