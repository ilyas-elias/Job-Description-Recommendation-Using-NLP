        "Job_Descriptions": "SVP, Lead Design Manager, Enterprise, Group Design, Consumer Banking Group Business Function As the leading bank in Asia, DBS Consumer Banking Group is in a unique position to help our customers realise their dreams and ambitions. As a market leader in the consumer banking business, DBS has a full spectrum of products and services, including deposits, investments, insurance, mortgages, credit cards and personal loans, to help our customers realise their dreams and aspirations at every life stage. Our financial solutions are not only the best in the business - they were made just right for you. What you'll be doing You will inspire your team with your bold vision and clear and consistent direction. You will network to find rising stars, lead design reviews at the executive level, evangelise the importance of design and help us measure and quantify the value of design. At times, you may need to get your hands dirty and help the team push their project forward. Ultimately your remit is to leverage design to create experiences (i.e., tools, services) that DBS employees will value and love in order to empower them to do their best work. Here's what your week might look like A lot of our managers choose to start the week with a team meeting, followed by one-on-ones during which you connect and check-in with your one-downs and other team members. Planning upcoming efforts, clearing roadblocks for your team and nurturing relationships within and beyond ongoing projects will be an important part of your day-to-day worklife. You will spend a lot of time meeting stakeholders spanning functions in business, product, technology and countries. You will help us create processes that really work, so we can move on to solving new challenges rather than re-solving existing problems. There is nothing more important than a clear, bold and consistent vision. You will hold alignment meetings, design reviews, brainstorming sessions and go for numerous coffees-all to make sure everyone is on the same page. We believe design can be the axis around which innovation happens. So we want you to help us drive a company-wide cultural change towards design-led innovation. You will also spend a good chunk of your time measuring and reporting on results, followed by championing UX enhancements based on data analysis. Our leadership team takes user experience very seriously. That means we don't measure our work using only soft metrics (such as how well the user testing went), but also by its business impact (such as adoption, growth, revenue, retention and margins). Even with a team as large as ours (the larger UX team comprises 100+ people from 20 different countries), you will need to engage freelancers and agencies from time to time. We are proud of our team culture and employee retention, so making sure your team members have a clear career development path and are equipped do do their best work will be two of your key priorities. Here are the experience and skills we'd love you to have Design Leadership & Excellence You have 10+ years of experience in Interaction Design / UX Design with at least 4 years' experience working and leading a team (preferably in medium or large organisations). You have the ability to make trade-offs in an environment of sometimes conflicting objectives. For example, you are not afraid of standing up to push back on decisions if it will result in a bad experience for customers and employees. You have experience in digital methods, information architecture, interaction design, service design and Scrum/Agile management. Executive Maturity & Stakeholder Mgmt You can talk confidently and clearly about design at various levels in the organisation and build lasting relationships with our stakeholders. People Mgmt & Growth You are genuinely interested in human behaviour, care about each individual and know how to make your team function, so that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Vision You have a clear vision for each product and project you work on-one profound idea. You don't let it get diluted, and you are able to communicate and execute it. You are passionate and curious about the cultural and socio-economic changes many tech, business companies are going through and the creative opportunities they present. Motivation / Perseverance / Grit You persevere to see your long-term vision through. You don't give up at the first hurdle because sometimes change takes time. You identify and focus on the aspects that will make a difference / drive outcomes. Bonus Points You have experience working in Asia. You have experience running enterprise level projects. You are good at rapid prototyping and are comfortable with methodologies like whiteboard facilitation (visual note-taking, ideation, quick sketching & lo-fi wire framing). Your Team and Career The Enterprise design unit within group design looks at making employees' journeys joyful. This team will be working on improving internal tools at an enterprise level across service units. This is a leadership role, based in Singapore. Depending on your experience, you will manage designers to deliver one of our high-priority projects or manage all UX projects within one of our larger business units. You will report directly to the Chief Design Officer. This is a management level role in Group Design. About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. We were named the Best Bank in the World by EuroMoney in 2020 and 2021-the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this honour. Banking Awards & Accolades | DBS Bank We want our customers to Live more, Bank less. And we want to make banking invisible. Every day, there's a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy-and a lot less time to do it in. That's why we've created banking that's fast, natural, effortless. Banking that's with you wherever life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank. About Group Design Hi! We are the DBS user experience and design team We create digital products that deserve to be built because they solve real problems in an impactful way with empathy. How we design We go beyond numbers Every dollar means something. No one actually wants money. We want what it can give us. So we acknowledge that money is not really about money. We inject emotion into our products to go from transactional to magical. We have one profound idea Because ambiguity is the enemy of good user experience. What is our unique value proposition? Would adding another feature dilute the idea or make it stronger? Help us rock the boat 'I want to work at a bank' said no designer ever. But they really should say that. Because banking isn't boring. Not when you're in it with a great bunch of people who are ready to rock the boat.

        "Job_Descriptions": "This position allows you to join us as a financial consultant in one of the top groups in Financial Alliance. Financial Alliance Pte Ltd is the leading Independent Financial Advisory firm in Singapore. We partner with 19 Life Insurance companies, 16 Bank Loan partners, 34 General Insurers, 71 Asset Management Firms and 5 Estate Planning Partners. By partnering with a wide range of insurance companies, investment houses and other wealth management solution providers, we pride ourselves to be able to align with our client's interests and independently structure the most fitting solution to fit our clients' needs in an unbiased manner. What makes us different from insurance agents, bankers or financial advisers? Anyone can design a financial plan, yet only an Independent Financial Advisor Representative has the resources to provide the most suitable and cost-effective holistic financial plan for the client. More importantly, if you're a client, would you prefer engaging a banker (salaried by a bank), an insurance agent (commission paid by insurance companies) or an independent financial adviser representative (income paid by clients - alignment with the clients' interests)? What's our team's Core Purpose? We are a boutique group of independent financial advisor representatives in Singapore, brought together by a shared purpose: to help more people achieve financial freedom, sooner. The path of a financial advisor representative is an entrepreneurial one, where we build a client base who pays us for our service, growing over time into a business that generates substantial income for us in the long term. When our clients achieve financial freedom, we will also achieve financial freedom ourselves. The Benefits: 1. Your income is directly determined by your personal work efforts, and if you're doing the right things, you will feel like you're overpaid for the work you do. 2. There will be start-up support schemes to help you transition into building your financial advisory practice during the first year. Afterwhich, you will be receiving recurring income that provides a degree of certainty in your income stream. 3. As your production increases, your share of the revenue will eventually increase to 80%; amongst the most attractive remuneration models in the Financial Advisory industry. 4. You will develop valuable & empowering high-income skillsets; people skills, sales skills and financial know-how. 5. The work you do is very meaningful, which is empowering clients to reach their financial independence. 6. You will build a portfolio of clients whom interests you are aligned with and so it'll feel like your work consists of meeting friends to catch up, and we get paid for doing this. 7. You will be able to manage your time to determine your ideal work-life balance and live life on your terms. 8. You get to determine how successful you are as the promotion criteria and remuneration model is clear, and there is no office politics; you are rewarded based on your own effort and achievements. Only you can retrench yourself!"
