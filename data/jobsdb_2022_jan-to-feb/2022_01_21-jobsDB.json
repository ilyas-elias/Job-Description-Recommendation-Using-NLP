Project Title Investigation of Device Reliability and Degradation Mechanisms in RF Operation Project Objective / Purpose (Introduction) To investigate device degradation mechanisms under DC and RF stress. Project Description Device reliability is typically qualified based on DC stress testing that does not reflect the actual device operation under RF conditions. One of the ways to characterize and \"predict\" reliability more accurately is through the use of ageing models, which is based on the quasi-static extrapolation of DC data to estimate actual degradation seen in RF operation, but this is not widely-accepted as there are still doubts over its accuracy. In this project, the candidate would be given the opportunity (1) to conduct stress testing of MOS devices under DC and RF conditions, in order to (2) investigate the various degradation mechanisms under RF operating conditions, and (3) study the limitations of a quasi-static approach to propose an improved methodology to do RF reliability assessment. Project Outcome Results from this project should help towards the development of a model that allows the prediction of device lifetime under RF stress based on DC stress results."
