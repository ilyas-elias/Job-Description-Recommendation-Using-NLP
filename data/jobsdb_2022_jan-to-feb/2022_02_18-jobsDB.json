(Well but she got a standard for arts) We're a new company and your boss can't get tattoos (yes, that's true, but she still has an artistic criterion) 2. We are POOR and most of the money earned from first few months will be throwing into marketing & advertising. (not lying, better consider first before apply) The company is very poor (capitalized), and the profits from getting up early will be invested in marketing and advertising (I didn't lie to anyone, you may need to think about it before deciding whether to apply or not) 3. Ok, here comes the important thing. You can have any kind of personality but definitely not having any morality or personal hygiene issues. Here comes the point, you can have a personality but never allow poor morals and personal hygiene, thank you 4. You must know how to REJECT customers. Whenever customer brings in an inappropriate picture or those pictures that he/she would definitely regret in the future, please say NO! ( Well if you like the picture too, ermmm, i think we'll have a voting session) You have to reject those with inappropriate pictures or some pictures that he/she may regret later, say NO. (But if you also like those pictures....then....let's talk) 5. Submit your resume and include 3 of your best tattoo work photos. Please select 3 of your tattoo works that you think are the best and put them in your resume for my appreciation Further details (Salary, bonus, working hour etc) will be discussed when 2 artists are found. The details will be discussed together after both tattoo artists find them (money, money, money or something) Last but not least, starting might be tough for us but WE will get through this!

Come join our medical start-up. EndoSiq Technology Pte Ltd is a medical start-up developing an advanced machine vision tracking system for the management of Overactive Bladder (OAB). Our goal is to design and develop a proprietary diagnostic tool to analyze real-time images of the bladder. The diagnostic tool will help pinpoint unusual muscle group activity to help in the treatment of OAB. We need passionate and flexible engineers to grow with us. EndoSiq Technology Pte Ltd is incubated by Trendlines Medical Singapore Pte Ltd. Project Name: Deep-Learning architecture development involving 2D and 1D vascular datasets such as specklegram / photoplethysmogram biosignals for polymorphic determination in cardiometabolic diseases Background: Worldwide, a third of adults suffer from some form of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) which annually contribute to the deaths of 17.7 million people globally, accounting for 31% of total deaths. In comparison, the combined annual deaths resulting from HIV/Aids, malaria, and tuberculosis combined only amount to 3.86 million. Hypertension affects at least 25% of the global adult population and is the most common cause of CVD-related deaths due to associated secondary pathologies. There is also a significant association of hypertension with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) with hypertension being twice as frequent in diabetic sufferers compared to non-diabetics. By 2050, Singapore projects that there will be 1 million sufferers of diabetes, accounting for 10% of the disease burden in Singapore. Disease prediction solely from genotyping has resulted in poor associations due to unexpected multi-nomic interactions. Scope: This project proposal seeks to apply advanced Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) algorithms on 1D/2D datasets to identify potential pleiotropic relationships in cardiometabolic diseases. We will also evaluate the predictive performance and accuracy of various AI-ML algorithms. The objective is to develop an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) architecture extracting critical features from the pulsatile morphology of 1-Dimensional PPG signals or 2D vascular videos to form an adaptive numerical model of an individual. Due difficulty in acquiring real-world biosignal datasets, novel techniques will need to be implemented to address the limited data available for training such as autonomous semi-supervised neural network designs. The project will involve 1D/2D signal processing and deep learning and will require strong knowledge in Python programming.
