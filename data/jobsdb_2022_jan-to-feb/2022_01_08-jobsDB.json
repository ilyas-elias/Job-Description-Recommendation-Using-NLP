How we evaluate them is by listening to the head, heart, and gut, from what is usually not captured on paper. Qualifications and work experience are relevant but are not exclusive proxies of capability. In shortlisting our candidates, we also look at instances of past work and evidence of a “can-do” attitude - we sometimes take a short call with candidates first to get to know them better before deciding whether to proceed with an interview. For internship positions, we are looking for students from local Institutes of Higher Learning who are able to commit for a minimum of 5 months. While the \"Cover Letter\" option has been set to mandatory, please feel free to keep it conversational, and let us know what excites you about the role. We also understand that the application process can be a tedious one, and commit to following up with every applicant who applies to us."
