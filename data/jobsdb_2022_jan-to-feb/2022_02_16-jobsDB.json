(Well but she got a standard for arts) We're a new company and your boss can't get tattoos (yes, that's true, but she still has an artistic criterion) 2. We are POOR and most of the money earned from first few months will be throwing into marketing & advertising. (not lying, better consider first before apply) The company is very poor (capitalized), and the profits from getting up early will be invested in marketing and advertising (I didn't lie to anyone, you may need to think about it before deciding whether to apply or not) 3. Ok, here comes the important thing. You can have any kind of personality but definitely not having any morality or personal hygiene issues. Here comes the point, you can have a personality but never allow poor morals and personal hygiene, thank you 4. You must know how to REJECT customers. Whenever customer brings in an inappropriate picture or those pictures that he/she would definitely regret in the future, please say NO! ( Well if you like the picture too, ermmm, i think we'll have a voting session) You have to reject those with inappropriate pictures or some pictures that he/she may regret later, say NO. (But if you also like those pictures....then....let's talk) 5. Submit your resume and include 3 of your best tattoo work photos. Please select 3 of your tattoo works that you think are the best and put them in your resume for my appreciation Further details (Salary, bonus, working hour etc) will be discussed when 2 artists are found. The details will be discussed together after both tattoo artists find them (money, money, money or something) Last but not least, starting might be tough for us but WE will get through this! Last but not least, the beginning is difficult, but don't worry, you are the best! Fast Apply No CV Required Fast Interview via Chat Report Job Share this job with your friends"

        "Job_Descriptions": "The Product Designers we really want to hire deliver real value to real users. In other words, they design stuff that gets built. If you are passionate about bringing simplicity to complex information systems - we have a challenge for you. What you'll be doing You'll spend most of your time trying to simplify very complex products and ideas. It may be an uphill battle, but it's worth it. If you succeed, your designs will enable thousands of people to serve millions of our customers better. We say that, if you can work in a bank, you can work anywhere. Don't worry, we're a nice bunch of people. Around here, we go out of our way to help one another. Here's what your week might look like You'll spend time with our wonderful research team. Together you'll try to understand the business goals of your project and, more often than not, meet the stakeholders to redefine the problem statement. Once you know where you're going, it's time to tackle the behemoth tech systems and legal restrictions of a bank. Your product manager will become your best friend. You'll message the tech lead more than your parents. You'll get a crash course in finance law. We do respect the privacy of people with headphones-on, trying to avoid eye contact. So you'll have the time to actually produce work you're proud of. We want to hire people who have opinions, believe in their ideas and are willing to fight for them. But we also want people who can recognise when a better argument or solution is put before them. All of us participate in user testing, and so will you. Like we said, producing good work is not good enough if it doesn't get built. We love you, Dribble/Behance. It's not you, it's us. You will meet stakeholders from different departments and articulate your ideas so clearly that you'll become an honorary Toastmaster. To prepare for those meetings you'll need to check the latest relevant data. Before you know it, it will be Friday and time for team dinner, drinks or Creative Day (we do something fun and creative together once a month). Here are the experience and skills we'd love you to have You're an end-to-end designer: you can turn high-level requirements into well-posed problem statements, wireframes, prototypes or Powerpoints for the management teams. You can talk confidently and clearly about design and build lasting relationships with our stakeholders. And you're not afraid to improvise-to think on your feet-when required. You can brainstorm the next big thing one moment and still tweak pixels right before launch. You have the ability to prioritise (you don't focus on illustrations if the UX looks like a love child between Frankenstein and Krusty the Clown). You work smart and are ready to improve processes. You have enough curiosity to stay savvy about industry and UX trends. You have confidence in your ideas and the ability to communicate them clearly. You follow through-when built, your designs actually look and work like they should. You monitor products after launch and are ready to suggest improvements. Bonus points You actively contribute to the UX community. You're kind of a behavioural science geek. You have personal pet projects you work on for fun in your free time. You have experience with Agile methodology and financial products in Treasury domain is ideal Your team and career You will be part of the DBS enterprise design team. The enterprise design team is redefining what great internal tools look like: working on a collaborative platform to enable bankers, credit risk managers and credit controllers to manage corporate loans digitally. Behind the scenes, the team understands how important it is for a proper design process and system to be in place before great things can happen. About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. We were named the Best Bank in the World by Global Finance in August 2018-the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this honour. We want our customers to Live more, Bank less. And we want to make banking invisible. Every day, there's a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy-and a lot less time to do it in. That's why we've created banking that's fast, natural, effortless. Banking that's with you wherever life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank. About the design team Hi, we are the DBS user experience design team We create digital products that deserve to be built because they solve real problems in an impactful way with empathy. How we design We go beyond numbers Every dollar means something. No one actually wants money. We want what it can give us. So we acknowledge that money is not really about money. We inject emotion into our products to go from transactional to magical. We have one profound idea Because ambiguity is the enemy of good user experience. What is our unique value proposition? Would adding another feature dilute the idea or make it stronger? Connect with us https://www.instagram.com/dbsuxd/ https://medium.com/dbs-bank-design"

Come join our medical start-up. EndoSiq Technology Pte Ltd is a medical start-up developing an advanced machine vision tracking system for the management of Overactive Bladder (OAB). Our goal is to design and develop a proprietary diagnostic tool to analyze real-time images of the bladder. The diagnostic tool will help pinpoint unusual muscle group activity to help in the treatment of OAB. We need passionate and flexible engineers to grow with us. EndoSiq Technology Pte Ltd is incubated by Trendlines Medical Singapore Pte Ltd. Project Name: Deep-Learning architecture development involving 2D and 1D vascular datasets such as specklegram / photoplethysmogram biosignals for polymorphic determination in cardiometabolic diseases Background: Worldwide, a third of adults suffer from some form of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) which annually contribute to the deaths of 17.7 million people globally, accounting for 31% of total deaths. In comparison, the combined annual deaths resulting from HIV/Aids, malaria, and tuberculosis combined only amount to 3.86 million. Hypertension affects at least 25% of the global adult population and is the most common cause of CVD-related deaths due to associated secondary pathologies. There is also a significant association of hypertension with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) with hypertension being twice as frequent in diabetic sufferers compared to non-diabetics. By 2050, Singapore projects that there will be 1 million sufferers of diabetes, accounting for 10% of the disease burden in Singapore. Disease prediction solely from genotyping has resulted in poor associations due to unexpected multi-nomic interactions. Scope: This project proposal seeks to apply advanced Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) algorithms on 1D/2D datasets to identify potential pleiotropic relationships in cardiometabolic diseases. We will also evaluate the predictive performance and accuracy of various AI-ML algorithms. The objective is to develop an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) architecture extracting critical features from the pulsatile morphology of 1-Dimensional PPG signals or 2D vascular videos to form an adaptive numerical model of an individual. Due difficulty in acquiring real-world biosignal datasets, novel techniques will need to be implemented to address the limited data available for training such as autonomous semi-supervised neural network designs. The project will involve 1D/2D signal processing and deep learning and will require strong knowledge in Python programming.

        "Job_Descriptions": "Are you looking at teaching PSLE students MORE THAN JUST ACADEMICS? Join us on the mission to provide an education that inspires the Greatness in everyone. Just to give you some understanding of what ISUN stands for… And why PARENTS & STUDENTS all over Singapore came to ISUN for classes? ISUN Education is known to be a powerhouse of committed coaches who are passionate, performance driven and have a strong sense of purpose in education. At ISUN Education, we are known for PSLE Power Revision program. Over the last 13 years, we have personally worked with over 3717 students from both top schools and neighborhood schools, transforming both results and character of the students. We have impacted thousands of lives all over Singapore… by going the extra mile. It’s not just being a TUTOR/TEACHER/TUITION TEACHER. So what is this Academic Coach position all about?? 1. We are hiring 4 coaches who already have a certain skillset. Here’s who we are looking for: PSLE English Coach PSLE Science Coach PSLE Math Coach PSLE Chinese Coach Because ISUN wants coaches who are here to help our students, we are looking for teachers/tutors who are master at their subject and wants to take teaching & class management skills to the next level. Applicants need previous experience in teaching relevant content. 2. We will be working alongside with you during the onboarding training process. Whatever experiences you had in the past are great! WE would love our team to take on new challenges. However at the same time, you must be open to use ISUN strategies which has worked for thousands of students in the past 13 years. How about the ISUN Culture? 1. Building meaningful relationships with parents and students You can say that we are “kay-poh” but that’s because we take ownership and pride in each ISUN warrior’s life. 2. Put the smile back into learning We do crazy fun activities and hold events with the ISUN warriors to reignite the love for learning again. Happy coaches = happy students. 3. Building an excellence mindset We walk the talk. One of the rules for ISUN Warriors is: GIVE your 101%! It applies to us as well in the work that we do. 4. Second home to ISUN students and coaches When you give your best shot in doing what you love, your passion will influence the students and they will just like to stick around the place. (I.E. this is NOT just a JOB, this is a place where you live your purpose and spread the mission with us.) 5. Believing in the GREATNESS in every child Every child has a star in them waiting to be ignited. Every child wants to be the BEST. We believe it is the same for coaches. When you no longer want to be just MEDIOCRE and you are ready to put in the HARD WORK to unleash your own potential, it rubs off to the students. Is this role for you? These are the questions to ask yourself: 1. Are you ready to WALK THE TALK? Each coach gets to build their skills beyond teaching academics. When you grow beyond your comfort zone to achieve your success, your students do. So we need people who are HUNGRY for success and desires to the TOP expert in what they do. 2. Are you ready to PUT IN THE HARD WORK? It is the same as asking our students to gun for A&A*. How many people are willing to put go the extra mile to achieve their own A* goal in life? We need people who are results oriented and we believe in compensation that correlated with results. You are the limit! 3. Are you a team player? This is a second home to many of us – the students, the parents and the coaches. We want a place that is ZERO politics. 3. Are you someone who is goal oriented? It is easy to fall into the trap of spending time in a comfortable way. We need individuals who are self-driven, independent and proactive to hit the goals together as a team. If your answer is YES to all the above, take action now! WANT a chance to be part of the team that transform lives more than just academic results? (only apply if you have passion in teaching & you are a subject master)"

To do this we focus our efforts on making our guests feel welcome, happy and at home, from the moment they walk through the door to the moment we say goodbye. The role of the Service Team Member is to provide our guests with a friendly, professional and enjoyable dining experience. REPORTS TO: Outlet Manager, Duty Manager RESPONSIBLE FOR: Guest Experience KEY OBJECTIVES AND TARGETS Menu Guidance It is important for the Service Team Member to explain the menu to guests and to provide assistance with ordering and making suggestions when required. Service team members must inform guests if they have ordered too much food or if the meal is not balanced, this is done through suggesting alternative dishes. Service team members should also appropriately course the meal and inform guests as per the service training pack. Education & Information Every Loco team member must be passionate about Mexican food and drinks. For this role it is essential that you build a very good understanding of the food and drinks we are serve as well as Mexican culture, and be able to talk about it with guests if asked. You will be given a food and drinks training pack. It is essential that you study this and be ready to make really good recommendations to our guests and to answer any questions they may have. Sequence of Service To ensure we always provide amazing service to our guests, we all need to follow the same basic sequence of service. It is essential that all service team members always follow the service sequence as outlined in the Service Training Pack. This pack will help you learn our standards for welcoming and serving our guests, as well as dealing with sticky situations. Hospitality Customers need to be treated warmly and hospitably at all times. From the first moment a guest walks through the door they need to be attended to with a demeanor that portrays friendliness, comfort and professionalism. This impression needs to be made and then maintained right through their meal and upon their exit. If customers are not made to feel welcome, it is hard to encourage them to return. It is very important to always work with a big friendly happy smile & don’t forget to have fun and engage the guests. Your Tables & The Runners At the briefing prior to every shift, the Duty Manager will assign you to a section with specific tables for you to look after. The Duty Manager will endeavor to ensure that there is no overlap of assigned tables. This is to ensure we provide our guests with the best possible personalized experience and most importantly to minimize confusion. If you do happen to take an order for a table that is not assigned to you, you must inform the section owner immediately. Ideally the food and drinks runners will pass items for your tables to you to hand to your guests. This is to ensure that we provide a professional and informed experience. Occasionally when it is busy and you may be occupied taking an order for another table, the runner, for practical reasons, may drop food directly to the table. Please keep an eye out for this, and remind the runner to keep you informed. It is your responsibility to keep track of ordered and delivered items. Cashier Cashiers are Senior Service Team members who have been given additional responsibilities to settle guest bills. If you are selected to be a Cashier, you will be given formal training and the Cashier SOP by your Outlet Manager.

Managers will also carry out regular checks on these responsibilities to ensure you are not facing any issues. Examples of additional duties may be (but not limited to): stock taking of operational items, flower arrangements, opening set up duties, closing duties, maintenance of specific items. MEASURING PERFORMANCE Customer Requests It is very important to always maintain awareness of your guests and try to continually monitor and anticipate guest needs before they occur. The best way to do this is to continually do the \"circuit\". Always look up and around for guests in need and most of all be accessible and in view of your guests. Customer Feedback It’s very important to check back on your guests to ensure they are having the best possible experience and so we can identify any issues that we can rectify before its too late. Make sure as soon as you are aware of any issues that you let the manager in charge know. It is also important that you remind the guests to fill out the feedback form at the end of their meal, as it is a great way for us to receive feedback and improve. DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES: 1) Always follow the sequence of service as set out in the service training pack. 2) Build product knowledge and be able to recommend good menu choices and answer any questions your guests may have. 3) Opening & closing restaurant as guided by the manager in charge. 4) Cleanliness and tidiness of the restaurant. 5) Always maintain good hygiene practices, tidy appearance and correct uniform at all times. 6) Perform any other tasks or responsibilities to a high standard that have been delegated to you by the Outlet Manager or duty manager in charge."

So if you have junior - mid level experience and are passionate about driving product adoption and brand awareness, this is the ideal opportunity for you. If you also know a bit about SQL and Braze, then this is an added bonus but by no means compulsory.

Working with the APAC CRM manager to manage and implement other projects Manage internal stakeholder communication (Product Marketing Managers, UX Researchers, Designers, Copywriters etc.) Manage and enforce Wise’s communication processes Responsible for email calendar management, deliverability and monthly reporting Implement the localisation process for Wise’s international campaigns Maintain and implement a clear testing plan for all APAC campaigns.

Sure, the heart of what we do is international money transfer. And we’re committed to making it instant, convenient and fair for millions of people, all over the world. But we’re growing our other products and our teams at an exciting pace. And we’re looking for the very best to jump on board. What it’s really like to work here: At Wise, we do things a bit differently. There’s no corporate nonsense, and no old-fashioned hierarchy. Instead, we work in dozens of self-sufficient, autonomous teams. Think of them like start-ups within a start-up. Each team picks the problems they want to solve. So, there’s no micro-management. No hiding behind fancy job titles. And no one is telling you what to do. You are your own boss. But you’ll get tons of guidance and plenty of support from your talented, super-smart teammates. We’re going to be upfront — the way we work doesn’t suit everyone. But if freedom, and life-affirming, head-scratching professional challenges rock your world, we could be a match made in heaven.

ISUN Education is known to be a powerhouse of committed coaches who are passionate, performance driven and have a strong sense of purpose in education. At ISUN Education, we are known for PSLE Power Revision program. Over the last 13 years, we have personally worked with over 3717 students from both top schools and neighborhood schools, transforming both results and character of the students. We have impacted thousands of lives all over Singapore… by going the extra mile. It’s not just being a TUTOR/TEACHER/TUITION TEACHER. So what is this Academic Coach position all about?? 1. We are hiring 4 coaches who already have a certain skillset. Here’s who we are looking for: PSLE English Coach PSLE Science Coach PSLE Math Coach PSLE Chinese Coach Because ISUN wants coaches who are here to help our students, we are looking for teachers/tutors who are master at their subject and wants to take teaching & class management skills to the next level. Applicants need previous experience in teaching relevant content. 2. We will be working alongside with you during the onboarding training process. Whatever experiences you had in the past are great! WE would love our team to take on new challenges. However at the same time, you must be open to use ISUN strategies which has worked for thousands of students in the past 13 years.

(I.E. this is NOT just a JOB, this is a place where you live your purpose and spread the mission with us.) 5. Believing in the GREATNESS in every child Every child has a star in them waiting to be ignited. Every child wants to be the BEST. We believe it is the same for coaches. When you no longer want to be just MEDIOCRE and you are ready to put in the HARD WORK to unleash your own potential, it rubs off to the students. Is this role for you? These are the questions to ask yourself: 1. Are you ready to WALK THE TALK? Each coach gets to build their skills beyond teaching academics. When you grow beyond your comfort zone to achieve your success, your students do. So we need people who are HUNGRY for success and desires to the TOP expert in what they do. 2. Are you ready to PUT IN THE HARD WORK? It is the same as asking our students to gun for A&A*. How many people are willing to put go the extra mile to achieve their own A* goal in life? We need people who are results oriented and we believe in compensation that correlated with results. You are the limit! 3. Are you a team player? This is a second home to many of us – the students, the parents and the coaches. We want a place that is ZERO politics. 3. Are you someone who is goal oriented? It is easy to fall into the trap of spending time in a comfortable way. We need individuals who are self-driven, independent and proactive to hit the goals together as a team.

We need people who are results oriented and we believe in compensation that correlated with results. You are the limit! 3. Are you a team player? This is a second home to many of us – the students, the parents and the coaches. We want a place that is ZERO politics. 3. Are you someone who is goal oriented? It is easy to fall into the trap of spending time in a comfortable way. We need individuals who are self-driven, independent and proactive to hit the goals together as a team. If your answer is YES to all the above, take action now! WANT a chance to be part of the team that transform lives more than just academic results? (only apply if you have passion in teaching & you are a subject master)"
