This ensures our customers deploy a solution that is fast to market, highly performant and scalable, and allows them to realize the overall business objectives of their digital transformation program. Salesforce Industries serves the world's largest companies with the most complete and innovative suite of industry-focused, customer-centric & omnichannel solutions. Built in partnership with Salesforce, it is 100% native and additive to the Salesforce platform with 3 fundamental layers: An extensive industry-specific data model. A complete set of industry-specific business processes and integrations. A full range of industry-specific omnichannel experiences and apps (including sales, marketing, service, enterprise product catalog, CPQ, contract management, order management and commerce solutions). Salesforce Industries has invested over $100m in R&D to extend Salesforce and deliver these industry-specific capabilities as out-of-the-box products. This has all been designed and built in complete collaboration with the Salesforce engineering teams. These out-of-the-box products support our customers rapid time-to-market, simplified processes, increased agility and ongoing innovation. All at a lower cost of ownership to the business. However, these business advantages are only gained if the out-of-the-box product is fully leveraged, implemented properly and deployed as designed. This demands a complete and comprehensive understanding of the out-of-the-box product supported by strong program governance and deep enterprise architecture experience. This is where Salesforce Industries Program Architects delivers a critical service. With your unique combination of deep Salesforce, Salesforce Industries, Enterprise Architecture and Industry experience, you have the knowledge and expertise to ensure that our customers are fully leveraging their investment in the platform and taking full advantage of the out-of-the-box functionality. As a Salesforce Industries Program Architect, you will have 10+ years of industry experience, undergo the most rigorous and comprehensive Salesforce and Salesforce Industries training, collaborate with our engineering teams on a daily basis, and have complete coverage of the Salesforce Industries out-of-the-box product at every layer. Salesforce Industries Program Architects are aware of every element of the industry data model, every business process available in the library, and every component of the omnichannel user experience. This means that when our customers have a business requirement that needs addressing, you understand how to deliver it using the out-of-the-box capabilities and avoid the need for customisation. As a Salesforce Industries Program Architect, you will not be an additional resource on the project team or compared to a traditional services role. Rather, your role brings a very specific range of strategic, industry, Salesforce, Salesforce Industries, and CRM architecture skills to the table. Your value maps directly to the business value gained through leveraging the Salesforce Industries product 100% with the resulting rapid time-to-market, simplified processes, increased agility and ongoing innovation. Not to mention the cost avoidance of customization, deployment delays, errors with mission critical systems, and the inability to take advantage of ongoing innovation and upgrades. From our experience, the overall success of any digital transformation program, which is often a significant investment, is directly tied to the strategic involvement of a Salesforce Industries Program Architect from the start. RESPONSIBILITIES As a Salesforce Industries Program Architect, you are partnering with our leading customers to fully maximise their investment in the Salesforce Industries out-of-the-box product and implement the platform as it was designed. You will be responsible for ensuring our customers deploy a solution that is fast to market, highly performant and scalable, and allows them to realize the overall business objectives of their digital transformation program. It will be your responsibility to collaborate with our customers full-time, at the most senior level, to understand and execute against their long-term business strategy. You must build relationships at CxO, Business, IT and Enterprise Architecture level within the customer. Being able to engage and influence leaders across the customer team is critical to this role. You will be responsible for the overall Salesforce Industries architecture and design, providing best practice guidance and patterns to our customers, their partners and the implementation team. You will take a lead role in ongoing governance meetings and have the confidence to voice your opinions and challenge issues that you feel impact the program's success. You will maintain a deep knowledge and understanding of the industry vertical, and continually undergo the most vigorous product training and certification. You will be responsible for maintaining a complete awareness of the Salesforce Industries out-of-the-box product allowing you to support a product-led design approach from your customer. You will maintain your certification across all enabling platforms including Salesforce, Salesforce Industries and Amazon AWS. You will establish a direct line into the Salesforce Industries Product Management, on behalf of the customer, representing their needs and aligning on future roadmap and new release priorities. You will contribute to the growth of Program Architecture program globally, mentoring new team members in being successful in the role.

Responsibilities: This role is part of the Business Unit Management team covering APAC Commodities and is closely tied to the front line business involving a variety of day-to-day queries, investigations and ongoing projects across the full range of areas that impact the business. Examples are supporting the APAC Commodities head by overseeing sales production & trading issues, monitoring revenues and costs, stepping in when issues are not being resolved and there is a risk to the business operations, supporting the business to manage their headcount, identifying risk & control gaps and driving closure of the same and helping the business to get organized around delivering its strategic goals and new business initiatives including staying abreast of external market developments and assessing impacts to our business.

Business managers are often the hub of communication tying various parts of the organization together to solve problems. The candidate should demonstrate clear and concise written and verbal communication skills.
