        "Job_Descriptions": "Business Function As the leading bank in Asia, DBS Consumer Banking Group is in a unique position to help our customers realise their dreams and ambitions. As a market leader in the consumer banking business, DBS has a full spectrum of products and services, including deposits, investments, insurance, mortgages, credit cards and personal loans, to help our customers realise their dreams and aspirations at every life stage. Our financial solutions are not only the best in the business - they were made just right for you. What you'll be doing: Your goal will be to create amazing content for our web and mobile apps. What do we mean by amazing? It's content that helps our users achieve the task at hand faster. If your content is good, it will become invisible. It will be so clear, succinct, and helpful that our users will forget they're reading and simply focus on what they have to do. Here's what your week might look like: You'll spend time with product designers, researchers, and business owners to understand the goals of a new feature or the re-design of an old one. You'll do some competitive research online. You'll analyse data and make data-driven content decisions. You'll open Figma, go through the design flow and create your first draft. You'll also jot down a bunch of questions and ideas. Then come the emails and meetings. You'll need to keep up with and summarise the feedback from various stakeholders and follow up to make sure you get the answers you need. To make sure your content sees the light of day, you'll need to do some grunt work—updating Figma files and content management systems, participating in demos and checking staging apps. Don't like grunt work? Good, neither do we, so we're constantly trying to improve our processes to make sure we have less of it to do. You'll be welcome to contribute! This role is regional, so you'll get to work with fantastic people from all over the region. The content you'll create will need to be internationalised and localised. Sometimes, you'll need to make changes to the source content to ensure it makes sense for another country. To summarise, you'll own the customer journey from a copy perspective and make sure there are no gaps in UX across all channels and touchpoints linked to the products. Here are the experience and skills we'd love you to have: You've been writing professionally for 3+ years. You have some content design experience. You have collaborated with developers and product managers. Bonus: You have collaborated with tech teams: developers, testers, scrum masters, etc. You have your own blog or website. Your team and career: This role sits within the Design Standards team and is based in Singapore. The Design Standards team creates our design language system and defines and steers the way we design digital services at DBS. The team covers eight countries, Consumer and Corporate banking, and Middle Office Management group (internal tools). You will report to a senior content designer. This is a senior associate or assistant vice president level role. As your career with us progresses, you will become the lead writer for some of our key projects, contribute to product improvements and help us create more efficient processes. Content design is a new discipline at DBS, and you will have a lot of opportunities to define the role content designers play in the design process. About the design team Hi, we are the DBS user experience design team We create digital products that deserve to be built because they solve real problems in an impactful way with empathy. How we design We go beyond numbers Every dollar means something. No one actually wants money. We want what it can give us. So, we acknowledge that money is not really about money. We inject emotion into our products to go from transactional to magical. We have one profound idea Because ambiguity is the enemy of good user experience. What is our unique value proposition? Would adding another feature dilute the idea or make it stronger? Connect with us https://www.instagram.com/dbsuxd/ https://medium.com/dbs-bank-design Apply Now We offer a competitive salary and benefits package and the professional advantages of a dynamic environment that supports your development and recognises your achievements."

We do this by building a communication and collaboration platform that slashes unnecessary emails and double data entry by connecting relevant data sources and providing a common work interface. Our vision is to standardize information exchange in international logistics like the container did for shipping – if successful, this will also boost global GDP.

        "Job_Descriptions": "What you'll be doing You'll spend most of your time trying to simplify very complex products and ideas. It may be an uphill battle, but it's worth it. If you succeed, your designs will be experienced by millions and solve real-life problems. We say that, if you can work in a bank, you can work anywhere. Don't worry, we're a nice bunch of people. Around here, we go out of our way to help one another ❤️. Here's what your week might look like You'll spend time with our wonderful research team. Together you'll translate user insights into tangible designs that address customer needs while meeting the business goals of the project. More often than not, You'll check on the latest relevant data, including product performance or revenue models,  to get a better understanding of the problem and meet the stakeholders to redefine the problem statement. Once you know where you're going, it's time to tackle the behemoth tech systems and legal restrictions of a bank. Your product manager will become your best friend. You'll message the tech lead more than your parents. You'll get a crash course in finance law. You will work closely with these buddies to help identify and prioritise their near and long term goals, and work out a product roadmap and strategy with them. We want to hire people who have opinions, believe in their ideas and are willing to fight for them. But we also want people who can recognise when a better argument or solution is put before them. All of us participate in user testing, and so will you. Produce work you are proud of. This is where your craft comes in. Depending on the demands of the project, you should be familiar with creating user journey maps, service design blueprints, work on information architecture, produce wireframes and clickable prototypes for user validation sessions. We do respect the privacy of people with headphones-on, trying to avoid eye contact. So you'll have the time to focus on your stuff. Like we said, producing good work is not good enough if it doesn't get built. You will meet stakeholders from different departments and articulate your ideas so clearly that you'll become an honorary Toastmaster. Before you know it, it will be Friday and time for team dinner, drinks or Creative Day (we do something fun and creative together once a month). Here are the experience and skills we'd love you to have You have led and inspired a group of designers to produce great work. You can brainstorm the next big thing one moment and still tweak pixels right before launch. You have the ability to prioritise (you don't focus on illustrations if the UX looks like a love child between Frankenstein and Krusty the Clown). You work smart and are ready to improve processes. You have enough curiosity to stay savvy about industry and UX trends. You have confidence in your ideas and the ability to communicate them clearly. You follow through—when built, your designs actually look and work like they should. You monitor products after launch and are ready to suggest improvements. You have a burning desire to make things better and don't accept non-answers like 'that's just the way it has always been'. Bonus points You actively contribute to the UX community. You're kind of a behavioural science geek. You have personal pet projects you work on for fun in your free time. Your team and career You will be working closely with stakeholders and fellow designers within DBS Institutional Banking Group (IBG). The things you design will meet the needs of a range of customers from small sole-proprietorships to large global institutions with different departments and army of staff of varying levels with different needs. This role reports to a Design Lead for IBG. Depending on your career aspirations, you can continue to grow by pursuing perfection in your craft as an individual contributor or take on managerial responsibilities as a design manager. About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. We were named the Best Bank in the World by Global Finance in August 2018—the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this honour. We want our customers to Live more, Bank less. And we want to make banking invisible. Every day, there's a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy—and a lot less time to do it in. That's why we've created banking that's fast, natural, effortless. Banking that's with you wherever life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank. About the design team Hi, we are the DBS user experience design team We create digital products that deserve to be built because they solve real problems in an impactful way with empathy. How we design We go beyond numbers Every dollar means something. No one actually wants money. We want what it can give us. So we acknowledge that money is not really about money. We inject emotion into our products to go from transactional to magical. We have one profound idea Because ambiguity is the enemy of good user experience. What is our unique value proposition? Would adding another feature dilute the idea or make it stronger? Connect with us https://www.instagram.com/dbsuxd/ https://medium.com/dbs-bank-design"

As a market leader in the consumer banking business, DBS has a full spectrum of products and services, including deposits, investments, insurance, mortgages, credit cards and personal loans, to help our customers realise their dreams and aspirations at every life stage. Our financial solutions are not only the best in the business - they were made just right for you. Responsibilities You'll spend time with our wonderful research team. Together you'll translate user insights into tangible designs that address customer needs while meeting the business goals of the project. More often than not, You'll check on the latest relevant data, including product performance or revenue models, to get a better understanding of the problem and meet the stakeholders to redefine the problem statement. Once you know where you're going, it's time to tackle the behemoth tech systems and legal restrictions of a bank. Product manager will become your best friend. You'll message the tech lead more than your parents. You'll get a crash course in finance law. You will work closely with these buddies to help identify and prioritise their near and long term goals, and work out a product roadmap and strategy with them. We want to hire people who have opinions, believe in their ideas and are willing to fight for them. But we also want people who can recognise when a better argument or solution is put before them. All of us participate in user testing, and so will you. Produce work you are proud of. This is where your craft comes in. Depending on the demands of the project, you should be familiar with creating user journey maps, service design blueprints, work on information architecture, produce wireframes and clickable prototypes for user validation sessions. We do respect the privacy of people with headphones-on, trying to avoid eye contact. So you'll have the time to focus on your stuff. Like we said, producing good work is not good enough if it doesn't get built. You will meet stakeholders from different departments and articulate your ideas so clearly that you'll become an honorary Toastmaster. Before you know it, it will be Friday and time for team dinner, drinks or Creative Day (we do something fun and creative together once a month). Requirements We have senior and junior positions. Let us know what kind of role you're looking for when you apply. You can brainstorm the next big thing one moment and still tweak pixels right before launch. You have the ability to prioritise (you don't focus on illustrations if the UX looks like a love child between Frankenstein and Krusty the Clown). You work smart and are ready to improve processes. You have enough curiosity to stay savvy about industry and UX trends. You have confidence in your ideas and the ability to communicate them clearly. You follow through—when built, your designs actually look and work like they should. You monitor products after launch and are ready to suggest improvements. You have a burning desire to make things better and don't accept non-answers like 'that's just the way it has always been'. Bonus points You actively contribute to the UX community. You're kind of a behavioural science geek. You have personal pet projects you work on for fun in your free time. Your team and career You will be working closely with stakeholders and fellow designers within DBS Institutional Banking Group (IBG).

        "Job_Descriptions": "Positions are available for Research Fellows (Post-doctoral Fellows) in the group of Dr. Soh Siow Ling, at the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering in the National University of Singapore (NUS). The research of our group is highly interdisciplinary and spans across materials science, chemistry, physics, and engineering. One area of focus is the field of charge separation at the interface of matter. We use our knowledge in chemistry to understand the molecular mechanisms of charge separation (e.g., the type of charged molecules involved in the separation) and knowledge in materials science to fabricate the materials with the desired performance for charge separation. We also engineer the devices based on our fundamental results for developing novel applications. Based on our expertise, we are currently working on a diverse range of applications, including energy harvesting, removal of virus-loaded aerosol, separation, chemical analysis, and antistatic and anti-adhesive surfaces. The field is tremendously exciting because the science underlying the phenomena is poorly understood; hence, there are a lot of opportunities for fundamental discoveries and development of new applications. Another area of focus is functional stimuli-responsive polymers for developing “intelligent” chemical systems.

        "Job_Descriptions": "SVP, Lead Design Manager, Enterprise, Group Design, Consumer Banking Group Business Function As the leading bank in Asia, DBS Consumer Banking Group is in a unique position to help our customers realise their dreams and ambitions. As a market leader in the consumer banking business, DBS has a full spectrum of products and services, including deposits, investments, insurance, mortgages, credit cards and personal loans, to help our customers realise their dreams and aspirations at every life stage. Our financial solutions are not only the best in the business - they were made just right for you. What you'll be doing You will inspire your team with your bold vision and clear and consistent direction. You will network to find rising stars, lead design reviews at the executive level, evangelise the importance of design and help us measure and quantify the value of design. At times, you may need to get your hands dirty and help the team push their project forward. Ultimately your remit is to leverage design to create experiences (i.e., tools, services) that DBS employees will value and love in order to empower them to do their best work. Here's what your week might look like A lot of our managers choose to start the week with a team meeting, followed by one-on-ones during which you connect and check-in with your one-downs and other team members. Planning upcoming efforts, clearing roadblocks for your team and nurturing relationships within and beyond ongoing projects will be an important part of your day-to-day worklife. You will spend a lot of time meeting stakeholders spanning functions in business, product, technology and countries. You will help us create processes that really work, so we can move on to solving new challenges rather than re-solving existing problems. There is nothing more important than a clear, bold and consistent vision. You will hold alignment meetings, design reviews, brainstorming sessions and go for numerous coffees-all to make sure everyone is on the same page. We believe design can be the axis around which innovation happens. So we want you to help us drive a company-wide cultural change towards design-led innovation. You will also spend a good chunk of your time measuring and reporting on results, followed by championing UX enhancements based on data analysis. Our leadership team takes user experience very seriously. That means we don't measure our work using only soft metrics (such as how well the user testing went), but also by its business impact (such as adoption, growth, revenue, retention and margins). Even with a team as large as ours (the larger UX team comprises 100+ people from 20 different countries), you will need to engage freelancers and agencies from time to time. We are proud of our team culture and employee retention, so making sure your team members have a clear career development path and are equipped do do their best work will be two of your key priorities. Here are the experience and skills we'd love you to have Design Leadership & Excellence You have 10+ years of experience in Interaction Design / UX Design with at least 4 years' experience working and leading a team (preferably in medium or large organisations). You have the ability to make trade-offs in an environment of sometimes conflicting objectives. For example, you are not afraid of standing up to push back on decisions if it will result in a bad experience for customers and employees. You have experience in digital methods, information architecture, interaction design, service design and Scrum/Agile management. Executive Maturity & Stakeholder Mgmt You can talk confidently and clearly about design at various levels in the organisation and build lasting relationships with our stakeholders. People Mgmt & Growth You are genuinely interested in human behaviour, care about each individual and know how to make your team function, so that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Vision You have a clear vision for each product and project you work on-one profound idea. You don't let it get diluted, and you are able to communicate and execute it. You are passionate and curious about the cultural and socio-economic changes many tech, business companies are going through and the creative opportunities they present. Motivation / Perseverance / Grit You persevere to see your long-term vision through. You don't give up at the first hurdle because sometimes change takes time. You identify and focus on the aspects that will make a difference / drive outcomes. Bonus Points You have experience working in Asia. You have experience running enterprise level projects. You are good at rapid prototyping and are comfortable with methodologies like whiteboard facilitation (visual note-taking, ideation, quick sketching & lo-fi wire framing). Your Team and Career The Enterprise design unit within group design looks at making employees' journeys joyful. This team will be working on improving internal tools at an enterprise level across service units. This is a leadership role, based in Singapore. Depending on your experience, you will manage designers to deliver one of our high-priority projects or manage all UX projects within one of our larger business units. You will report directly to the Chief Design Officer. This is a management level role in Group Design. About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. We were named the Best Bank in the World by EuroMoney in 2020 and 2021-the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this honour. Banking Awards & Accolades | DBS Bank We want our customers to Live more, Bank less. And we want to make banking invisible. Every day, there's a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy-and a lot less time to do it in. That's why we've created banking that's fast, natural, effortless. Banking that's with you wherever life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank. About Group Design Hi! We are the DBS user experience and design team We create digital products that deserve to be built because they solve real problems in an impactful way with empathy. How we design We go beyond numbers Every dollar means something. No one actually wants money. We want what it can give us. So we acknowledge that money is not really about money. We inject emotion into our products to go from transactional to magical. We have one profound idea Because ambiguity is the enemy of good user experience. What is our unique value proposition? Would adding another feature dilute the idea or make it stronger? Help us rock the boat 'I want to work at a bank' said no designer ever. But they really should say that. Because banking isn't boring. Not when you're in it with a great bunch of people who are ready to rock the boat.

The acquisition of GI by malignant cells is critical to cancer development and progression. However, the magnitude and type of GI can vary widely across patients and cancer types. Delineating the underlying sources of GI will help identify novel therapeutic biomarkers (Pitt, Hoppe, & Jeyasekharan; PCT/SG2021/050105).

Using a multi-omic approach, these scores will be associated with clinical, genomic, and cell-type specific features. Candidate genes/variants will be investigated experimentally using CRISPR-mediated isogenic cell lines.

        "Job_Descriptions": "Job Description The Mechanobiology Institute (MBI), National University of Singapore (NUS), is seeking to recruit a Postdoctoral Fellow (Research Fellow) to join Research Asst. Prof. Anne BEGHIN’s group. The project will be focused on the study of the repair/regeneration processes of human epithelia using polarized organoids and quantitative 3D imaging. Based on previous works (patent and publications) and know-how of the group, the main goals of this project are: Method development to generate and differentiate thousands of epithelial organoids (mammary acini) in a well-defined environment and displaying an apical/basal polarization: Capsuloids, Screening the effect of external stresses to epithelium such as mechanical stresses or pollutants. The fellow will develop a method allowing to investigate the control of the proliferation and differentiation behaviours of cells in epithelial organoids such as mammary acini (but not limited to). Applications in immunology, cancer research or ageing-related diseases are clearly a perspective of this project. Also, combined with dedicated artificial intelligence, it has the promising potential to provide non-invasive control and guidance in the establishment of differentiation protocols for organoids and 3D culture in general. Finally, other applications in regenerative medicine and in planetary biology (response of epithelium to pollutants and modifications of planetary environment) will be explored. The specific project in this call focuses on high resolution imaging using SPIM and confocal imaging, microfabrication and cell culture methods. The newly hired fellow will utilize soSPIM technology developed in collaboration with several groups of MBI and with the nanofabrication core. Previous experience in microfabrication techniques are a plus, but training can be organized through the microfabrication core. The MBI and NUS provide state-of-the-art facilities dedicated to microfabrication and high-resolution imaging that will support the fellow in training, setup, and execution of the project. Requirements Candidates with a PhD in engineering, biology, biomedical sciences, or similar are encouraged to apply. The candidate should have a strong background in light imaging, cell culture and tissue biology. Prior knowledge of mammary epithelium, extracellular matrices, stem cells, image analysis and/or tissue preparation can be advantageous. The candidate should possess excellent communication skills and engage in collaborative research in a highly interdisciplinary environment. Applicants should apply here and also send an email to Research Asst. Prof. Anne BEGHIN at *******@nus.edu.sg, with 1) a brief description of research interests and experience, and 2) a full CV, with the names and contacts (email addresses) of two to three references.
