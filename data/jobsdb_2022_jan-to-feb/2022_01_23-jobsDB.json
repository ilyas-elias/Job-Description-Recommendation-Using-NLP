The AWS Startup Business Development team is seeking a scrappy, self-directed programs and operations manager to help us discover and support founders in all corners of the startup ecosystem. This role will work closely with Business Development Managers focused on nurturing relationships with the world's top accelerators, incubators, venture capital firms, and seed investors to build out the operational infrastructure needed for scale (thousands of startups) that can help us connect with thousands of founders per year.
