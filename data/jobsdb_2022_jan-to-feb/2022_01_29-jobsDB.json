        "Job_Descriptions": "What you'll be doing You will keep us on our toes. Remind us to look away from the comfort of our screens and back at the reality-where our customers live. You will keep asking, 'Why are we doing this again?'. And not be satisfied with the answer, 'If we build it, they will come. Here's what your week might look like Not everything has to be tested. You will identify when research is required and when best practices are the way to go. And you will help us communicate that to our stakeholders. You will do the groundwork: qualitative and quantitative research. We've done some interesting stuff: diary study (we got people to log all their payments and write about each), Ethnography (observe how small merchants are coping with digital payments) and others. In short, we love to experiment and hope you will join in. Once you've done the research, you'll create sharp and concise reports full of actionable findings. Your reports will be things of beauty that will inspire your colleagues to truly start seeing through the eyes of our customers. UX is a pretty established discipline here at DBS ( thanks to one person especially ), but we can always use help to evangelise the importance of good UX Research, and how, just because it has the word 'research' in it, it doesn't take months! Here are the experience and skills we'd love you to have You have 5 to 8 years of relevant experience. You've had hands-on involvement with an end-to-end research process. You have a working knowledge of qualitative and quantitative data analyses, usability testing, eye tracking, card sorting, survey evaluation, A/B and multivariate testing and heuristic evaluations. You can filter out noise to uncover actionable insights. In our experience, people who are organised, methodical and analytical are very good at this. You are an eloquent public speaker and an accomplished report-writer. You are an empathic human being with interest in psychology, anthropology, human-computer interaction, cognitive science and business. Bonus points You have experience in the fintech industry. You've been a designer yourself (or have some design experience). We find that it really helps when working with designers. You are a 'best practice junkie' and have a treasure trove of usability research around the best design pattern to use. You're kind of a behavioural science geek. Your team and career You will belong to two families: the Enterprise Group UX Design team and Research & Insights team. You will report to a research lead, and work very closely with people from Research & Insights. You will own user research for Enterprise key products. About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. We were named the Best Bank in the World by Global Finance in August 2018-the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this honour. We want our customers to Live more, Bank less. And we want to make banking invisible. Every day, there's a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy-and a lot less time to do it in. That's why we've created banking that's fast, natural, effortless. Banking that's with you wherever life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank. About the design team Hi, we are the DBS user experience design team We create digital products that deserve to be built because they solve real problems in an impactful way with empathy. How we design We go beyond numbers Every dollar means something. No one actually wants money. We want what it can give us. So we acknowledge that money is not really about money. We inject emotion into our products to go from transactional to magical. We have one profound idea Because ambiguity is the enemy of good user experience. What is our unique value proposition? Would adding another feature dilute the idea or make it stronger? Connect with us https://www.instagram.com/dbsuxd/ https://medium.com/dbs-bank-design"

As a market leader in the consumer banking business, DBS has a full spectrum of products and services, including deposits, investments, insurance, mortgages, credit cards and personal loans, to help our customers realise their dreams and aspirations at every life stage. Our financial solutions are not only the best in the business - they were made just right for you. About the design team Hi, we are the DBS user experience design team We create digital products that deserve to be built because they solve real problems in an impactful way with empathy. How we design We go beyond numbers Every dollar means something. No one actually wants money. We want what it can give us. So we acknowledge that money is not really about money. We inject emotion into our products to go from transactional to magical. We have one profound idea Because ambiguity is the enemy of good user experience. What is our unique value proposition? Would adding another feature dilute the idea or make it stronger? What you'll be doing You will keep us on our toes. Remind us to look away from the comfort of our screens and back at the reality-where our customers live. You will keep asking, 'Why are we doing this again?'. And not be satisfied with the answer, 'If we build it, they will come.' Here's what your week might look like Not everything has to be tested. You will identify when research is required and when best practices are the way to go. And you will help us communicate that to our stakeholders. You will do the groundwork: qualitative and quantitative research. We've done some interesting stuff: diary studies, ethnography, A/B testing, and others. In short, we love to experiment and hope you will join in. Once you've done the research, you'll create sharp and concise reports full of actionable findings. Your reports will be things of beauty that will inspire your colleagues to truly start seeing through the eyes of our customers. UX is a pretty established discipline here at DBS, but we can always use help to evangelise the importance of good UX Research, and how, just because it has the word 'research' in it, it doesn't take months! Here are the experience and skills we'd love you to have You have 2 to 5 years of relevant experience. You've had hands-on involvement with an end-to-end research process. You have a working knowledge of qualitative and quantitative data analyses, usability testing, eye tracking, card sorting, survey evaluation, A/B and multivariate testing and heuristic evaluations. You can filter out noise to uncover actionable insights. In our experience, people who are organised, methodical and analytical are very good at this. You are an eloquent public speaker and an accomplished report-writer. You are an empathic human being with interest in psychology, anthropology, human-computer interaction, cognitive science and business. Bonus points You have experience in the fintech industry. You've been a designer yourself (or have some design experience). We find that it really helps when working with designers. You are a 'best practice junkie' and have a treasure trove of usability research around the best design pattern to use. You're kind of a behavioural science geek. Your team and career You will report to a Consumer Banking Group research lead and will collaborate across the entire Research & Insights team to achieve team goals. You will own an area of user research for CBG. Apply Now We offer a competitive salary and benefits package and the professional advantages of a dynamic environment that supports your development and recognises your achievements."

        "Job_Descriptions": "The Product Designers we really want to hire deliver real value to real users. In other words, they design stuff that gets built. If you are passionate about bringing simplicity to complex information systems - we have a challenge for you. What you'll be doing You'll spend most of your time trying to simplify very complex products and ideas in order to reduce employee pain points - by looking into processes, policies, procedures and systems that support planning and operation of the bank. It may be an uphill battle, but it's worth it. If you succeed, your designs will enable thousands of people to serve millions of our customers better. We say that, if you can work in a bank, you can work anywhere. Don't worry if you don't have the relevant finance/domain knowledge, it's something you will pick up along the way, just be sure you're eager to learn and be immersed in the fintech world. Besides, we're a nice bunch of people. Around here, we go out of our way to help one another. Here's what your week might look like You'll spend time with our wonderful research team. Together you'll try to understand the business goals of your project and, more often than not, meet the stakeholders to redefine the problem statement. Once you know where you're going, it's time to tackle the behemoth tech systems and legal restrictions of a bank. Your product manager will become your best friend. You'll message the tech lead more than your parents. You'll get a crash course in finance law. We do respect the privacy of people with headphones-on, trying to avoid eye contact. So you'll have the time to actually produce work you're proud of. We want to hire people who have opinions, believe in their ideas and are willing to fight for them. But we also want people who can recognise when a better argument or solution is put before them. All of us participate in user testing, and so will you. Like we said, producing good work is not good enough if it doesn't get built. We love you, Dribble/Behance. It's not you, it's us. You will meet stakeholders from different departments Product Designer - MOT Finance 2 and articulate your ideas so clearly that you'll become an honorary Toastmaster. To prepare for those meetings you'll need to check the latest relevant data. Before you know it, it will be Friday and time for team dinner, drinks or Creative Day (we do something fun and creative together once a month). Here are the experience and skills we'd love you to have You're an end-to-end designer: you can turn high-level requirements into well-posed problem statements, wireframes, prototypes or Powerpoints for the management teams. You can talk confidently and clearly about design and build lasting relationships with our stakeholders. And you're not afraid to improvise-to think on your feet-when required. You can brainstorm the next big thing one moment and still tweak pixels right before launch. You have the ability to prioritise (you don't focus on illustrations if the UX looks like a love child between Frankenstein and Krusty the Clown). You work smart and are ready to improve processes. You have enough curiosity to stay savvy about industry and UX trends. You have confidence in your ideas and the ability to communicate them clearly. You follow through-when built, your designs actually look and work like they should. You monitor products after launch and are ready to suggest improvements. Bonus points You actively contribute to the UX community. You're kind of a behavioural science geek. You have personal pet projects you work on for fun in your free time. Your team and career You will be part of the DBS enterprise design team. The enterprise design team is redefining what great internal tools look like: working on a collaborative platform to enable bankers, credit risk managers and credit controllers to manage corporate loans digitally. Behind the scenes, the team understands how important it is for a proper design process and system to be in place before great things can happen. About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. We were named the Best Bank in the World by Global Finance in August 2018-the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this honour. We want our customers to Live more, Bank less. And we want to make banking invisible. Every day, there's a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy-and a lot less time to do it in. That's why we've created banking that's fast, natural, effortless. Banking that's with you wherever life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank About the design team Hi, we are the DBS user experience design team We create digital products that deserve to be built because they solve real problems in an impactful way with empathy. How we design We go beyond numbers Every dollar means something. No one actually wants money. We want what it can give us. So we acknowledge that money is not really about money. We inject emotion into our products to go from transactional to magical. We have one profound idea Because ambiguity is the enemy of good user experience. What is our unique value proposition? Would adding another feature dilute the idea or make it stronger? Connect with us https://instagram.com/dbs-bank-design https://medium.com/dbs-bank-design"

As a market leader in the consumer banking business, DBS has a full spectrum of products and services, including deposits, investments, insurance, mortgages, credit cards and personal loans, to help our customers realise their dreams and aspirations at every life stage. Our financial solutions are not only the best in the business – they were made just right for you. About the design team Hi, we are the DBS user experience design team We create digital products that deserve to be built because they solve real problems in an impactful way with empathy. How we design We go beyond numbers Every dollar means something. No one actually wants money. We want what it can give us. So we acknowledge that money is not really about money. We inject emotion into our products to go from transactional to magical. We have one profound idea Because ambiguity is the enemy of good user experience. What is our unique value proposition? Would adding another feature dilute the idea or make it stronger? What you'll be doing You will keep us on our toes. Remind us to look away from the comfort of our screens and back at the reality—where our customers live. You will keep asking, 'Why are we doing this again?'. And not be satisfied with the answer, 'If we build it, they will come.' Here's what your week might look like Not everything has to be tested. You will identify when research is required and when best practices are the way to go. And you will help us communicate that to our stakeholders. You will do the groundwork: qualitative and quantitative research. We've done some interesting stuff: diary studies, ethnography, A/B testing, and others. In short, we love to experiment and hope you will join in. Once you've done the research, you'll create sharp and concise reports full of actionable findings. Your reports will be things of beauty that will inspire your colleagues to truly start seeing through the eyes of our customers. UX is a pretty established discipline here at DBS, but we can always use help to evangelise the importance of good UX Research, and how, just because it has the word 'research' in it, it doesn't take months! Here are the experience and skills we'd love you to have You have 2 to 5 years of relevant experience. You've had hands-on involvement with an end-to-end research process. You have a working knowledge of qualitative and quantitative data analyses, usability testing, eye tracking, card sorting, survey evaluation, A/B and multivariate testing and heuristic evaluations. You can filter out noise to uncover actionable insights. In our experience, people who are organised, methodical and analytical are very good at this. You are an eloquent public speaker and an accomplished report-writer. You are an empathic human being with interest in psychology, anthropology, human-computer interaction, cognitive science and business. Bonus points You have experience in the fintech industry. You've been a designer yourself (or have some design experience). We find that it really helps when working with designers. You are a 'best practice junkie' and have a treasure trove of usability research around the best design pattern to use. You're kind of a behavioural science geek. Your team and career You will report to a Consumer Banking Group research lead and will collaborate across the entire Research & Insights team to achieve team goals. You will own an area of user research for CBG.

        "Job_Descriptions": "The Product Designers we really want to hire deliver real value to real users. In other words, they design stuff that gets built. If you are passionate about bringing simplicity to complex information systems — we have a challenge for you. What you'll be doing You'll spend most of your time trying to simplify very complex products and ideas in order to reduce employee pain points - by looking into processes, policies, procedures and systems that support planning and operation of the bank. It may be an uphill battle, but it's worth it. If you succeed, your designs will enable thousands of people to serve millions of our customers better. We say that, if you can work in a bank, you can work anywhere. Don't worry if you don't have the relevant finance/domain knowledge, it's something you will pick up along the way, just be sure you're eager to learn and be immersed in the fintech world. Besides, we're a nice bunch of people. Around here, we go out of our way to help one another. Here's what your week might look like You'll spend time with our wonderful research team. Together you'll try to understand the business goals of your project and, more often than not, meet the stakeholders to redefine the problem statement. Once you know where you're going, it's time to tackle the behemoth tech systems and legal restrictions of a bank. Your product manager will become your best friend. You'll message the tech lead more than your parents. You'll get a crash course in finance law. We do respect the privacy of people with headphones-on, trying to avoid eye contact. So you'll have the time to actually produce work you're proud of. We want to hire people who have opinions, believe in their ideas and are willing to fight for them. But we also want people who can recognise when a better argument or solution is put before them. All of us participate in user testing, and so will you. Like we said, producing good work is not good enough if it doesn't get built. We love you, Dribble/Behance. It's not you, it's us. You will meet stakeholders from different departments Product Designer - MOT Finance 2 and articulate your ideas so clearly that you'll become an honorary Toastmaster. To prepare for those meetings you'll need to check the latest relevant data. Before you know it, it will be Friday and time for team dinner, drinks or Creative Day (we do something fun and creative together once a month). Here are the experience and skills we'd love you to have You're an end-to-end designer: you can turn high-level requirements into well-posed problem statements, wireframes, prototypes or Powerpoints for the management teams. You can talk confidently and clearly about design and build lasting relationships with our stakeholders. And you're not afraid to improvise—to think on your feet—when required. You can brainstorm the next big thing one moment and still tweak pixels right before launch. You have the ability to prioritise (you don't focus on illustrations if the UX looks like a love child between Frankenstein and Krusty the Clown). You work smart and are ready to improve processes. You have enough curiosity to stay savvy about industry and UX trends. You have confidence in your ideas and the ability to communicate them clearly. You follow through—when built, your designs actually look and work like they should. You monitor products after launch and are ready to suggest improvements. Bonus points You actively contribute to the UX community. You're kind of a behavioural science geek. You have personal pet projects you work on for fun in your free time. Your team and career You will be part of the DBS enterprise design team. The enterprise design team is redefining what great internal tools look like: working on a collaborative platform to enable bankers, credit risk managers and credit controllers to manage corporate loans digitally. Behind the scenes, the team understands how important it is for a proper design process and system to be in place before great things can happen. About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. We were named the Best Bank in the World by Global Finance in August 2018—the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this honour. We want our customers to Live more, Bank less. And we want to make banking invisible. Every day, there's a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy—and a lot less time to do it in. That's why we've created banking that's fast, natural, effortless. Banking that's with you wherever life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank About the design team Hi, we are the DBS user experience design team We create digital products that deserve to be built because they solve real problems in an impactful way with empathy. How we design We go beyond numbers Every dollar means something. No one actually wants money. We want what it can give us. So we acknowledge that money is not really about money. We inject emotion into our products to go from transactional to magical. We have one profound idea Because ambiguity is the enemy of good user experience. What is our unique value proposition? Would adding another feature dilute the idea or make it stronger? Connect with us https://instagram.com/dbs-bank-design https://medium.com/dbs-bank-design"

        "Job_Descriptions": "AVP / Senior Associate, UX Researcher, Enterprise, Group Design What you'll be doing You will keep us on our toes. Remind us to look away from the comfort of our screens and back at the reality-where our customers live. You will keep asking, 'Why are we doing this again?'. And not be satisfied with the answer, 'If we build it, they will come. Here's what your week might look like Not everything has to be tested. You will identify when research is required and when best practices are the way to go. And you will help us communicate that to our stakeholders. You will do the groundwork: qualitative and quantitative research. We've done some interesting stuff: diary study (we got people to log all their payments and write about each), Ethnography (observe how small merchants are coping with digital payments) and others. In short, we love to experiment and hope you will join in. Once you've done the research, you'll create sharp and concise reports full of actionable findings. Your reports will be things of beauty that will inspire your colleagues to truly start seeing through the eyes of our customers. UX is a pretty established discipline here at DBS ( thanks to one person especially ), but we can always use help to evangelise the importance of good UX Research, and how, just because it has the word 'research' in it, it doesn't take months! Here are the experience and skills we'd love you to have You have 5 to 8 years of relevant experience. You've had hands-on involvement with an end-to-end research process. You have a working knowledge of qualitative and quantitative data analyses, usability testing, eye tracking, card sorting, survey evaluation, A/B and multivariate testing and heuristic evaluations. You can filter out noise to uncover actionable insights. In our experience, people who are organised, methodical and analytical are very good at this. You are an eloquent public speaker and an accomplished report-writer. You are an empathic human being with interest in psychology, anthropology, human-computer interaction, cognitive science and business. Bonus points You have experience in the fintech industry. You've been a designer yourself (or have some design experience). We find that it really helps when working with designers. You are a 'best practice junkie' and have a treasure trove of usability research around the best design pattern to use. You're kind of a behavioural science geek. Your team and career You will belong to two families: the Enterprise Group UX Design team and Research & Insights team. You will report to a research lead, and work very closely with people from Research & Insights. You will own user research for Enterprise key products. About DBS DBS is a leading financial services group in Asia. We are headquartered in Singapore, with a growing presence in Greater China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. We were named the Best Bank in the World by Global Finance in August 2018-the first Singapore and Asian bank to receive this honour. We want our customers to Live more, Bank less. And we want to make banking invisible. Every day, there's a lot more to explore, experience and enjoy-and a lot less time to do it in. That's why we've created banking that's fast, natural, effortless. Banking that's with you wherever life takes you, instead of taking you away from life. So you can enjoy a lot more life, with a lot less bank. About the design team Hi, we are the DBS user experience design team We create digital products that deserve to be built because they solve real problems in an impactful way with empathy. How we design We go beyond numbers Every dollar means something. No one actually wants money. We want what it can give us. So we acknowledge that money is not really about money. We inject emotion into our products to go from transactional to magical. We have one profound idea Because ambiguity is the enemy of good user experience. What is our unique value proposition? Would adding another feature dilute the idea or make it stronger? Connect with us https://www.instagram.com/dbsuxd/ https://medium.com/dbs-bank-design"
