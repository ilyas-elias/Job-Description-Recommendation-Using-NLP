Sqkii is known for our #HuntTheMouse and #HuntFromHome campaigns that give away cold, hard cash to players. In the good old pre-COVID days, our hunts and custom games got Singaporeans squatting in random spots and running after golden eggs. For now, we’re bringing players on virtual adventures through their mobile screens — they’re still super cool, just ask the mouse. We paid a virtual visit to the player community in Malaysia in 2020 with #HuntFromHome — Around The World, and oh boy do we have big plans ahead for SEA and beyond. Big plans = lots more humans coming up, so we’re on the hunt for someone who loves other humans to hop aboard this journey with us. As our Community Manager Intern, you’ll be trusted with growing and knowing the mouse’s human friends, i.e. Sqkii’s player community (we also call most of them hunters). We’re looking for someone who’s excited to talk to other humans and genuinely wants to hear them out, so that we can build even better games for everyone to enjoy. On that note, you might even find yourself playing or hosting a game or two; we’re open to any and all ideas, so if you’re convinced that having a mini-game with our hunters will liven things up, well, why not? In fact, if you’ve got an idea swimming around now... Our Operations team is more than ready to meet you. Your move. P.S. After you’ve applied, we’ll send over some secret tasks for you to try your hand at before we arrange for a virtual chat! What you’ll be doing: Defining and developing a community management strategy Monitoring and optimising community engagement levels Driving growth of Sqkii’s existing playtester base Conceptualising and organising community-building initiatives to cultivate player participation in community forums What you’ll need: A strong understanding of the way online communities function and typical rules, cultures, and environments of such communities Strong interpersonal skills and the desire and ability to build genuine relationships Familiarity with social media platforms and their communities, including Telegram, Discord, and Facebook High empathy and a people-oriented mindset"

Come join our medical start-up. EndoSiq Technology Pte Ltd is a medical start-up developing an advanced machine vision tracking system for the management of Overactive Bladder (OAB). Our goal is to design and develop a proprietary diagnostic tool to analyze real-time images of the bladder. The diagnostic tool will help pinpoint unusual muscle group activity to help in the treatment of OAB. We need passionate and flexible engineers to grow with us. EndoSiq Technology Pte Ltd is incubated by Trendlines Medical Singapore Pte Ltd. Project Name: Deep-Learning architecture development involving 2D and 1D vascular datasets such as specklegram / photoplethysmogram biosignals for polymorphic determination in cardiometabolic diseases Background: Worldwide, a third of adults suffer from some form of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) which annually contribute to the deaths of 17.7 million people globally, accounting for 31% of total deaths. In comparison, the combined annual deaths resulting from HIV/Aids, malaria, and tuberculosis combined only amount to 3.86 million. Hypertension affects at least 25% of the global adult population and is the most common cause of CVD-related deaths due to associated secondary pathologies. There is also a significant association of hypertension with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) with hypertension being twice as frequent in diabetic sufferers compared to non-diabetics. By 2050, Singapore projects that there will be 1 million sufferers of diabetes, accounting for 10% of the disease burden in Singapore. Disease prediction solely from genotyping has resulted in poor associations due to unexpected multi-nomic interactions. Scope: This project proposal seeks to apply advanced Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) algorithms on 1D/2D datasets to identify potential pleiotropic relationships in cardiometabolic diseases. We will also evaluate the predictive performance and accuracy of various AI-ML algorithms. The objective is to develop an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) architecture extracting critical features from the pulsatile morphology of 1-Dimensional PPG signals or 2D vascular videos to form an adaptive numerical model of an individual. Due difficulty in acquiring real-world biosignal datasets, novel techniques will need to be implemented to address the limited data available for training such as autonomous semi-supervised neural network designs. The project will involve 1D/2D signal processing and deep learning and will require strong knowledge in Python programming.
