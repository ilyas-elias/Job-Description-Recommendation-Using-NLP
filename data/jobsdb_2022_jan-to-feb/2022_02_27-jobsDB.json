        "Job_Descriptions": "About Standard Chartered We are a leading international bank focused on helping people and companies prosper across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. To us, good performance is about much more than turning a profit. It's about showing how you embody our valued behaviours - do the right thing, better together and never settle - as well as our brand promise, Here for good. We're committed to promoting equality in the workplace and creating an inclusive and flexible culture - one where everyone can realise their full potential and make a positive contribution to our organisation. This in turn helps us to provide better support to our broad client base. The Role Responsibilities The purpose of the Senior Operational Risk Officer (SORO) role is to support the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) Functions (COO, Technology & Innovation) by developing and maintaining deep knowledge of the COO Function and its risk landscape and to act as the single point of contact (‘SPOC’) within the Second-Line in respect of all Operational Risk matters, collaborating as appropriate with Centres of Expertise (‘COEs’). The COO & GBS Functions include - Cyber Security Services (CSS), Operational Resilience comprising of Business Continuity Management (BCM), Operational Continuity in Resolution (OCIR) and Crisis Management (CM), Data Management and Privacy, Analytics and Automation, GBS Global Business Services, Financial Crime Surveillance Office (FCSO) and Enablement & Transformation (E&T) office. This role includes accountability for monitoring and ensuring that the COO Functions meet their obligations under the various Principal Risk Types (PRT) frameworks (especially the Operational & Technology Risk Type Framework (‘O&T RTF’)) and that breaches / weaknesses are appropriately identified and escalated. Focus will be applied in defined COO areas but does not negate providing support across all COO pillars when required. This accountability is discharged in part through collaboration with other Second-Line Operational Risk teams and COEs, as well as enterprise-wide SMEs.
