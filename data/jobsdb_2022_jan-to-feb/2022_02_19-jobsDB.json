Its opening saw long lines at all hours and intense media attention. Tim Ho Wan quickly became a household name. With its combination of quality and affordability, Tim Ho Wan won over the taste buds of discerning and value-conscious Singaporeans to be the top dim sum restaurant in Singapore.

Tim Ho Wan’s first international restaurant opened at Plaza Singapura in 2013. Replicating the same taste of its Hong Kong counterpart, it was an unbridled success. Its opening saw long lines at all hours and intense media attention. Tim Ho Wan quickly became a household name. With its combination of quality and affordability, Tim Ho Wan won over the taste buds of discerning and value-conscious Singaporeans to be the top dim sum restaurant in Singapore.

(Well but she got a standard for arts) We're a new company and your boss can't get tattoos (yes, that's true, but she still has an artistic criterion) 2. We are POOR and most of the money earned from first few months will be throwing into marketing & advertising. (not lying, better consider first before apply) The company is very poor (capitalized), and the profits from getting up early will be invested in marketing and advertising (I didn't lie to anyone, you may need to think about it before deciding whether to apply or not) 3. Ok, here comes the important thing. You can have any kind of personality but definitely not having any morality or personal hygiene issues. Here comes the point, you can have a personality but never allow poor morals and personal hygiene, thank you 4. You must know how to REJECT customers. Whenever customer brings in an inappropriate picture or those pictures that he/she would definitely regret in the future, please say NO! ( Well if you like the picture too, ermmm, i think we'll have a voting session) You have to reject those with inappropriate pictures or some pictures that he/she may regret later, say NO. (But if you also like those pictures....then....let's talk) 5. Submit your resume and include 3 of your best tattoo work photos. Please select 3 of your tattoo works that you think are the best and put them in your resume for my appreciation Further details (Salary, bonus, working hour etc) will be discussed when 2 artists are found. The details will be discussed together after both tattoo artists find them (money, money, money or something) Last but not least, starting might be tough for us but WE will get through this!

        "Job_Descriptions": "About Standard Chartered We are a leading international bank focused on helping people and companies prosper across Asia, Africa and the Middle East. To us, good performance is about much more than turning a profit. It's about showing how you embody our valued behaviours - do the right thing, better together and never settle - as well as our brand promise, Here for good. We're committed to promoting equality in the workplace and creating an inclusive and flexible culture - one where everyone can realise their full potential and make a positive contribution to our organisation. This in turn helps us to provide better support to our broad client base. The Role Responsibilities Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) has a bold ambition to be the number one learning function in the financial services: “having world-class learning that unlocks the unique potential of our people and helps them contribute their best to Standard Chartered and our clients, both today and as we transform into the future”. To achieve this ambition, the People Capability function has reinvented its organisation design to organise around Hives, Disciplines and Squads. In this model: Multi-disciplinary “Squads’’ deliver work to achieve the function’s priorities. Squads are comprised of practitioners from different Disciplines, with different skills, levels of expertise and backgrounds. “Priorities” are the way in which work is organised and relate to unique areas of delivery. Squads delivering on different projects within the same strategic priority are grouped together and called “Hives’’. All Squad members are “Discipline’’ practitioners and are dynamically allocated to Squads through Disciplines: Disciplines are the ‘homes’ for practitioners to develop their professional excellence and to maintain a common approach to similar activities and tasks. They provide a stable community for practitioners to belong to (as people move across Squads). They enable multi-skilling and development of depth and breadth or “T-shaped” capabilities. Currently, there are three Disciplines within People Capability: Innovation and Insight: Applying a research based and future focused approach which identifies marketplace stories of transformation and innovation underpinned by analysis of trends and insights that enriches and challenges all strategic discussions on our vision, priorities and practices. Learning Technology: Designing an omnichannel architecture and experience through careful integration of digital learning technology platforms, tools and experiential practices which enable the design of challenging, creative and impactful learning experiences. Creative and Delivery: Bringing the best stories of learning experiences into the design and delivery of human centred, business critical and commercially viable solutions that make real-world impact and behavioural/ skill changes for our workforce. Strategic importance of role The People Capability function has concluded a significant transformation to modernise the function and deliver learning more efficiently and effectively for our stakeholders. The learning transformation ultimately aims to realise our vision to be the number one learning organization in financial services. The Head Special Projects and Business Impact role enables the transformation to have the desired impact across the organisation.
