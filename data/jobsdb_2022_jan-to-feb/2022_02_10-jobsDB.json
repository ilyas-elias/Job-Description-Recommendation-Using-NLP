Hypertension affects at least 25% of the global adult population and is the most common cause of CVD-related deaths due to associated secondary pathologies. There is also a significant association of hypertension with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) with hypertension being twice as frequent in diabetic sufferers compared to non-diabetics. By 2050, Singapore projects that there will be 1 million sufferers of diabetes, accounting for 10% of the disease burden in Singapore. Disease prediction solely from genotyping has resulted in poor associations due to unexpected multi-nomic interactions. Scope: This project proposal seeks to apply advanced Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) algorithms on 1D/2D datasets to identify potential pleiotropic relationships in cardiometabolic diseases. We will also evaluate the predictive performance and accuracy of various AI-ML algorithms. The objective is to develop an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) architecture extracting critical features from the pulsatile morphology of 1-Dimensional PPG signals or 2D vascular videos to form an adaptive numerical model of an individual. Due difficulty in acquiring real-world biosignal datasets, novel techniques will need to be implemented to address the limited data available for training such as autonomous semi-supervised neural network designs. The project will involve 1D/2D signal processing and deep learning and will require strong knowledge in Python programming.

And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do - you can’t put us in a box!

We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward. So, you have colorful hair?

        "Job_Descriptions": "Job Description Internship Opportunities in Biomedical Research At our Company, we are committed to be the premier, research-intensive biopharmaceutical company and are dedicated to providing leading innovations and solutions for today and the future. Our mission is to discover, develop and provide medicines and vaccines that save and improve lives around the world. We strive to transform breakthrough science into novel therapeutics and vaccines and our scientific curiosity drives us to invent solutions to some of the world's most challenging diseases. Many begin in the our Research Laboratories, where we push the boundaries of science with the hope and expectation that the medicines and vaccines we invent will lead to better health for society for generations to come. In Singapore, our Translational Medicine Research Centre is located within the Biopolis, the heart of Singapore’s biomedical research community. Here, we are focused on identifying and validating new drug targets, exploring innovative therapeutic modalities and leveraging clinical studies and patient–derived material to understand biomarkers of disease or therapeutic response to increase our understanding of human biology and to drive a therapeutic pipeline to address unmet medical needs. Our state-of-the-art laboratory supports discovery biology and translational medicine and is an integral part of our Company's world-class network for drug and vaccine discovery. As an intern within our research laboratories, you will gain the opportunity to work with talented and dedicated scientists, learn from leading industry experts, gain exposure and professional experience working for a research-driven enterprise; and use your passion, creativity, knowledge and collaboration skills to find solutions to challenging problems in your day-to-day work. Position Title: Research Intern, Cancer Biology (Quantitative Biosciences) Job Purpose: The Research Intern will work closely with an assigned scientific supervisor on a lab-based biomedical research project in the area of target validation, immuno-oncology or cancer biology. Project title: Optimization of intracellular mRNA delivery Chemically modified messenger RNA (mRNA) are a highly promising therapeutic modality to treat various diseases. Recent advances in mRNA technology accompanied with the successes of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNtech have generated momentum to this field. However, delivery to the specific target site and off-target toxicities remain to be addressed with mRNA therapeutics. pH and redox-responsive coacervating peptides were recently developed to efficiently deliver various cargo including proteins, peptides and mRNA into the cell. In this project, the intern will characterize coacervates to deliver mRNA and perform comparisons with other in vitro delivery vehicles (Lipid nanoparticles (LNP), transfection reagents) in terms of mRNA expression and vehicle-induced toxicity in cell lines of interest. With respect to toxicity, this could be probed further by looking at innate immune activation which has been reported to be triggered by some LNPs. It would also be worthwhile to explore their mechanism of entry into cells, which is currently hypothesized to be endocytosis-independent, so this could be compared to cargo delivered via dfTAT which triggers leakage of endosomes. In addition, there could be the opportunity to test and evaluate other coacervating peptide analogs, with the goal of identifying an appropriate coacervate vehicle to deliver mRNA in vivo. Learning Outcome to be gained by the intern Key learnings for student: mRNA therapeutics, Molecular biology and signaling pathways, Cell culture and mRNA transfection, Cellular assays e.g. viability/toxicity assays, imaging techniques, western blotting, Data analysis and presentation Qualification: Enrollment in an Undergraduate or Master’s program leading to a Diploma/Degree in a Biomedical Sciences, Biological Sciences or Life Sciences-related discipline.

        "Job_Descriptions": "We are looking to host solution-minded student to embark their internship journey with us. Here’s your chance to create a journey with us. Come join our medical start-up. EndoSiq Technology Pte Ltd is a medical start-up developing an advanced machine vision tracking system for the management of Overactive Bladder (OAB). Our goal is to design and develop a proprietary diagnostic tool to analyze real-time images of the bladder. The diagnostic tool will help pinpoint unusual muscle group activity to help in the treatment of OAB. We need passionate and flexible engineers to grow with us. EndoSiq Technology Pte Ltd is incubated by Trendlines Medical Singapore Pte Ltd. Project Name: Deep-Learning architecture development involving 2D and 1D vascular datasets such as specklegram / photoplethysmogram biosignals for polymorphic determination in cardiometabolic diseases Background: Worldwide, a third of adults suffer from some form of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) which annually contribute to the deaths of 17.7 million people globally, accounting for 31% of total deaths. In comparison, the combined annual deaths resulting from HIV/Aids, malaria, and tuberculosis combined only amount to 3.86 million. Hypertension affects at least 25% of the global adult population and is the most common cause of CVD-related deaths due to associated secondary pathologies. There is also a significant association of hypertension with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) with hypertension being twice as frequent in diabetic sufferers compared to non-diabetics. By 2050, Singapore projects that there will be 1 million sufferers of diabetes, accounting for 10% of the disease burden in Singapore. Disease prediction solely from genotyping has resulted in poor associations due to unexpected multi-nomic interactions. Scope: This project proposal seeks to apply advanced Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) algorithms on 1D/2D datasets to identify potential pleiotropic relationships in cardiometabolic diseases. We will also evaluate the predictive performance and accuracy of various AI-ML algorithms. The objective is to develop an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) architecture extracting critical features from the pulsatile morphology of 1-Dimensional PPG signals or 2D vascular videos to form an adaptive numerical model of an individual. Due difficulty in acquiring real-world biosignal datasets, novel techniques will need to be implemented to address the limited data available for training such as autonomous semi-supervised neural network designs. The project will involve 1D/2D signal processing and deep learning and will require strong knowledge in Python programming. Application Deadline: 1 May 2022"

We also work to improve the merchant-partner experience through product innovation and integration with the rest of the Gojek ecosystem. Internally, we promote a culture of engineering excellence, learning, and guided career growth. We advocate sustainable engineering practices, innovation, and working smart more so than working hard. We aim to be a world-class organization, implementing world-class solutions, with world-class engineers leading the way. Our portfolio of products includes merchant-facing solutions that enable our subscribed merchant-partners to sell their goods and services both online and offline. Southeast Asia is a highly dynamic market, where products have to react promptly to market trends and shifts, and where product managers and business leads need the flexibility to experiment and iterate fast. With that in mind, from an engineering perspective, our challenges are to evolve a general platform for e-commerce that is sufficiently versatile to support rapid product iterations across multiple products, as well as scaling up to an ever-growing user base. To tackle these challenges, we have adopted event-driven architectural patterns in our engineering designs, as well as agile practices across all our day-to-day processes. This COVID era has been hard on all of us. Off-hours, we are doing our best to stay in touch and continue to bond through fun, playful online activities. Once COVID is over, we are looking forward to resuming our regular team-wide social activities such as dinner-and-drinks evenings and team off-sites."
