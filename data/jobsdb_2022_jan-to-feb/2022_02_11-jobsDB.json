In 2010 it established the Singapore-ETH Centre (SEC) in collaboration with the National Research Foundation (NRF) to do interdisciplinary research on pressing problems. The Singapore-ETH Centre is home to a community of doctoral, postdoctoral, and professorial researchers working in three main programmes: Future Cities Laboratory , Future Resilient Systems , and Future Health Technologies . The centre provides a multicultural and interdisciplinary environment to researchers working on diverse themes, with the shared vision of translating research to practical solutions for more sustainable and liveable cities, resilient physical and social urban systems, and patient-centric healthcare systems. In collaboration with the National University of Singapore (NUS) and A*STAR-SIFBI SEC is undertaking a research project on Urban Single-Cell Protein Production Harnessing Emerging Microalgae-based Up- and Downstream Concepts . It addresses some immanent food security associated challenges by developing an urban single-cell protein production and R&D platform that tackles the challenge of increasing Singapore's domestic food supply resulting from the quest for independence and a rapidly growing and steadily ageing population, covering the value-chain from primary production to food concept development. Project Background Singapore targets increasing its domestic, independent food supply under urbanized constraints by 30% until 2030. The project aims to enable independent, domestic, resilient, and urban food/protein supply by consumer relevant bright yellow heterotrophic microalgae biomass: 1) Establish a state-of-the-art urban single-cell protein production platform using food processing side-streams to leverage supply-chain sustainability and mitigate costs employing circular economy concepts. 2) Innovate supply-chain eco-efficiency by improving microalgae production efficiency and final product affordability through pulsed electric field processing. 3) Build an R&D platform for concrete food concept development of meat alternatives harnessing extrusion and 3D-printing for large-scale and decentralised food supply. 4) Understand the Singaporean consumers preferences and needs related to innovative microalgae-based food products. The project delivers affordable, palatable, and nutritious microalgae-based food products to the market. It strengthens Singapore's food security, provides strategic and economic benefits through stimulating economic productivity, and leverages global competitiveness on the meat alternative market. Job Description As a Doctoral Researcher you will be responsible for research that aims to develop, test, and validate a pulsed electric field (PEF)-based biorefinery concept to ameliorate single-cell value-chain efficiency. This work will be performed in collaboration with our research partners at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and A*STAR-SIFBI.

Come join our medical start-up. EndoSiq Technology Pte Ltd is a medical start-up developing an advanced machine vision tracking system for the management of Overactive Bladder (OAB). Our goal is to design and develop a proprietary diagnostic tool to analyze real-time images of the bladder. The diagnostic tool will help pinpoint unusual muscle group activity to help in the treatment of OAB. We need passionate and flexible engineers to grow with us. EndoSiq Technology Pte Ltd is incubated by Trendlines Medical Singapore Pte Ltd. Project Name: Deep-Learning architecture development involving 2D and 1D vascular datasets such as specklegram / photoplethysmogram biosignals for polymorphic determination in cardiometabolic diseases Background: Worldwide, a third of adults suffer from some form of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) which annually contribute to the deaths of 17.7 million people globally, accounting for 31% of total deaths. In comparison, the combined annual deaths resulting from HIV/Aids, malaria, and tuberculosis combined only amount to 3.86 million. Hypertension affects at least 25% of the global adult population and is the most common cause of CVD-related deaths due to associated secondary pathologies. There is also a significant association of hypertension with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) with hypertension being twice as frequent in diabetic sufferers compared to non-diabetics. By 2050, Singapore projects that there will be 1 million sufferers of diabetes, accounting for 10% of the disease burden in Singapore. Disease prediction solely from genotyping has resulted in poor associations due to unexpected multi-nomic interactions. Scope: This project proposal seeks to apply advanced Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) algorithms on 1D/2D datasets to identify potential pleiotropic relationships in cardiometabolic diseases. We will also evaluate the predictive performance and accuracy of various AI-ML algorithms. The objective is to develop an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) architecture extracting critical features from the pulsatile morphology of 1-Dimensional PPG signals or 2D vascular videos to form an adaptive numerical model of an individual. Due difficulty in acquiring real-world biosignal datasets, novel techniques will need to be implemented to address the limited data available for training such as autonomous semi-supervised neural network designs. The project will involve 1D/2D signal processing and deep learning and will require strong knowledge in Python programming.
