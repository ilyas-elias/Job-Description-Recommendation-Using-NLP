Using secure data and networks, partnerships and passion, our innovations and solutions help individuals, financial institutions, governments and businesses realize their greatest potential. Our decency quotient, or DQ, drives our culture and everything we do inside and outside of our company. We cultivate a culture of inclusion for all employees that respects their individual strengths, views, and experiences. We believe that our differences enable us to be a better team – one that makes better decisions, drives innovation and delivers better business results. Job Title Senior Data Analyst - NuData IntegrationJob Description Mastercard’s Cyber & Intelligence Solutions organization develops and delivers world-class security products and services for customers across the globe.  NuData Security predicts fraudulent transactions by identifying good users from bad, based on their online behaviour. By analyzing over 38 billion behaviours annually, NuData harnesses the power of behavioural and biometric analysis to empower its clients to predict fraud and verify the user behind the device. This allows clients to predict fraud before a critical decision, reduce customer insult, and investigate bad actors efficiently. We are looking for a Data Analyst to join our team in our Singapore office. You are a determined pattern-finder, one that delights in the tough puzzles because nothing satisfies like finally cracking one. Dig into weird, needle-in-a-haystack Internet-based fraud cases. Ferret out suspicious behaviour from the innocuous. Decipher the pattern, find the fraud and then figure out how to catch it in the future. You’ll back up your findings with deep statistical analysis and robust data modelling, which will go on to inform feature design and fraud investigation strategy for NuData product offerings. Qualifications: •    Exceptional written and verbal communication skills, with an advanced level of experience in presenting to various audiences (both size and type of audience). •    Intermediate level of data analysis and reporting experience in professional setting; •    Experience dealing with large data sets; •    Experience with SQL and the ability to create complex queries and joins; •    Strong data analysis and data modelling skills; In addition to these qualifications, you will be required to provide a professional sample of technical writing from a previous project or position. Candidates without experience in a professional setting will not be considered for this role. Bonus points: •    Experience with machine learning (supervised or unsupervised); •    Experience with high level programming languages: Python, PHP, or similar; •    Experience with data tools: R, SPSS, SAS and Tableau; •    High level concepts of Web Services, Internet Security and Online Behavioural Analysis. COVID-19 Considerations We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice. In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted.  Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team.  Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time.  Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard. Corporate Security Responsibility All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must: Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices; Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed; Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines."

This job posting may be weird, but it's really hiring 2 tattoo artists Things you need to know: You need to know the following: 1. We are a newly set up company, your boss don't know how to tattoo. (Well but she got a standard for arts) We're a new company and your boss can't get tattoos (yes, that's true, but she still has an artistic criterion) 2. We are POOR and most of the money earned from first few months will be throwing into marketing & advertising. (not lying, better consider first before apply) The company is very poor (capitalized), and the profits from getting up early will be invested in marketing and advertising (I didn't lie to anyone, you may need to think about it before deciding whether to apply or not) 3. Ok, here comes the important thing. You can have any kind of personality but definitely not having any morality or personal hygiene issues. Here comes the point, you can have a personality but never allow poor morals and personal hygiene, thank you 4. You must know how to REJECT customers. Whenever customer brings in an inappropriate picture or those pictures that he/she would definitely regret in the future, please say NO! ( Well if you like the picture too, ermmm, i think we'll have a voting session) You have to reject those with inappropriate pictures or some pictures that he/she may regret later, say NO. (But if you also like those pictures....then....let's talk) 5. Submit your resume and include 3 of your best tattoo work photos.
