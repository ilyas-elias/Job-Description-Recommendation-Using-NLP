This job posting may be weird, but it's really hiring 2 tattoo artists Things you need to know: You need to know the following: 1. We are a newly set up company, your boss don't know how to tattoo. (Well but she got a standard for arts) We're a new company and your boss can't get tattoos (yes, that's true, but she still has an artistic criterion) 2. We are POOR and most of the money earned from first few months will be throwing into marketing & advertising. (not lying, better consider first before apply) The company is very poor (capitalized), and the profits from getting up early will be invested in marketing and advertising (I didn't lie to anyone, you may need to think about it before deciding whether to apply or not) 3. Ok, here comes the important thing. You can have any kind of personality but definitely not having any morality or personal hygiene issues. Here comes the point, you can have a personality but never allow poor morals and personal hygiene, thank you 4. You must know how to REJECT customers. Whenever customer brings in an inappropriate picture or those pictures that he/she would definitely regret in the future, please say NO! ( Well if you like the picture too, ermmm, i think we'll have a voting session) You have to reject those with inappropriate pictures or some pictures that he/she may regret later, say NO. (But if you also like those pictures....then....let's talk) 5. Submit your resume and include 3 of your best tattoo work photos. Please select 3 of your tattoo works that you think are the best and put them in your resume for my appreciation Further details (Salary, bonus, working hour etc) will be discussed when 2 artists are found. The details will be discussed together after both tattoo artists find them (money, money, money or something) Last but not least, starting might be tough for us but WE will get through this!

Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company. We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare.

We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet. Project Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost. Athenian Project : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one. 1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers. Sound like something you’d like to be a part of?

Come join our medical start-up. EndoSiq Technology Pte Ltd is a medical start-up developing an advanced machine vision tracking system for the management of Overactive Bladder (OAB). Our goal is to design and develop a proprietary diagnostic tool to analyze real-time images of the bladder. The diagnostic tool will help pinpoint unusual muscle group activity to help in the treatment of OAB. We need passionate and flexible engineers to grow with us. EndoSiq Technology Pte Ltd is incubated by Trendlines Medical Singapore Pte Ltd. Project Name: Deep-Learning architecture development involving 2D and 1D vascular datasets such as specklegram / photoplethysmogram biosignals for polymorphic determination in cardiometabolic diseases Background: Worldwide, a third of adults suffer from some form of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) which annually contribute to the deaths of 17.7 million people globally, accounting for 31% of total deaths. In comparison, the combined annual deaths resulting from HIV/Aids, malaria, and tuberculosis combined only amount to 3.86 million. Hypertension affects at least 25% of the global adult population and is the most common cause of CVD-related deaths due to associated secondary pathologies. There is also a significant association of hypertension with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) with hypertension being twice as frequent in diabetic sufferers compared to non-diabetics. By 2050, Singapore projects that there will be 1 million sufferers of diabetes, accounting for 10% of the disease burden in Singapore. Disease prediction solely from genotyping has resulted in poor associations due to unexpected multi-nomic interactions. Scope: This project proposal seeks to apply advanced Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) algorithms on 1D/2D datasets to identify potential pleiotropic relationships in cardiometabolic diseases. We will also evaluate the predictive performance and accuracy of various AI-ML algorithms. The objective is to develop an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) architecture extracting critical features from the pulsatile morphology of 1-Dimensional PPG signals or 2D vascular videos to form an adaptive numerical model of an individual. Due difficulty in acquiring real-world biosignal datasets, novel techniques will need to be implemented to address the limited data available for training such as autonomous semi-supervised neural network designs. The project will involve 1D/2D signal processing and deep learning and will require strong knowledge in Python programming.

To prepare the Public Service for these changes, we have begun the journey towards Public Sector Transformation (PST). As part of the current phase of PST, ServiceSG aims to be on par with globally leading companies in our delivery of public services.

Our aim is to transform the current citizen experience of having to navigate across different public agencies to an experience of the Public Service “knowing, understanding and interacting with me as One”. There are currently more than 100 hotlines across the Whole of Government (WOG). The Contact Centre team in ServiceSG aims to work with agencies who own these hotlines to streamline and integrate these contact centres, especially those that provide related services. The goal is to establish a central ServiceSG contact centre that can address the queries of citizens across over 400 citizen related services, serving as a “outsourced shared service” for selected agencies.

What we are looking for We are looking for an experienced and motivated individual who can work autonomously in a fast-paced environment. You should be comfortable with ambiguity, be action-focused, and be comfortable to explore new ideas and work them to deliver desired outcomes. [Work Experience & Competencies] An ideal candidate should possess the following: [Customer Service and Case Management]: Demonstrate care and empathy in understanding citizen’s underlying needs and going the extra mile to help, and escalating issues/feedback to relevant agency stakeholders as part of the close-the-loop process for policies/services implementation.
