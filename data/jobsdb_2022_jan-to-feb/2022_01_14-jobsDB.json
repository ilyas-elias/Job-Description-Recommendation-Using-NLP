As a Creative, you’re the foundation of the Apple Store’s welcoming environment that invites individuals to share their ideas and learn how to bring their visions to life. Those who work alongside you are knowledgeable teammates just as eager to share their skills as they are to learn more. Nothing gives you a greater thrill than empowering a customer to create something wonderful. Description As a Creative, your main role at the Apple Store is that of instructor, whether guiding small groups to learn or helping individuals complete projects. You use your presentation skills to act as a facilitator, helping users get set up, get trained and get going. But you’re also an excellent listener, taking the time to understand what each user hopes to achieve or learn. By adjusting your teaching style to each user’s individual skill level, you maximize his or her understanding and your own time. You recognize that purchasing a new product can sometimes help customers attain their goals. You spend much of your time leading scheduled training sessions, but you’re still comfortable interacting with store customers between those sessions. You’re proud to enrich the lives of others — whether customers or team members — through teaching, in the way only a Creative can. Key Qualifications Passion for education and ability to instruct in a “hands-off” manner, letting users learn by doing. Ability to teach small groups and coach multiple customers simultaneously. Tenacity to work with users until they truly become independent and able to create on their own. Additional Requirements You’re comfortable selling as well as teaching, helping your team members out as needed. You’re self-motivated and self-directed, and can adhere to a tightly structured training schedule. You can be adept at recommending other in-store support options, such as business services and the Genius Bar. You’ll need to be flexible with your schedule. Your work hours will be based on business needs."

As a market leader in the consumer banking business, DBS has a full spectrum of products and services, including deposits, investments, insurance, mortgages, credit cards and personal loans, to help our customers realise their dreams and aspirations at every life stage. Our financial solutions are not only the best in the business - they were made just right for you. Responsibilities You'll spend most of your time trying to simplify very complex products and ideas. It may be an uphill battle, but it's worth it. If you succeed, your designs will enable thousands of people to serve millions of our customers better. We say that, if you can work in a bank, you can work anywhere. Don't worry, we're a nice bunch of people. Around here, we go out of our way to help one another. You'll spend time with our wonderful research team. Together you'll try to understand the business goals of your project and, more often than not, meet the stakeholders to redefine the problem statement. Once you know where you're going, it's time to tackle the behemoth tech systems and legal restrictions of a bank. Your product manager will become your best friend. You'll message the tech lead more than your parents. You'll get a crash course in finance law. We do respect the privacy of people with headphones-on, trying to avoid eye contact. So you'll have the time to actually produce work you're proud of. We want to hire people who have opinions, believe in their ideas and are willing to fight for them. But we also want people who can recognize when a better argument or solution is put before them. All of us participate in user testing, and so will you. Like we said, producing good work is not good enough if it doesn't get built. We love you, Dribble/Behance. It's not you, it's us. You will meet stakeholders from different departments and articulate your ideas so clearly that you'll become an honorary Toastmaster. To prepare for those meetings you'll need to check the latest relevant data. Before you know it, it will be Friday and time for team dinner, drinks or Creative Day (we do something fun and creative together once a month). Your team and career You will be part of the DBS enterprise design team. The enterprise design team is redefining what great internal tools look like: working on a collaborative platform to enable bankers, credit risk managers and credit controllers to manage corporate loans digitally. Behind the scenes, the team understands how important it is for a proper design process and system to be in place before great things can happen. Experience You're an end-to-end designer: you can turn high-level requirements into well-posed problem statements, wireframes, prototypes or Powerpoints for the management teams. You can talk confidently and clearly about design and build lasting relationships with our stakeholders. And you're not afraid to improvise—to think on your feet—when required. You can brainstorm the next big thing one moment and still tweak pixels right before launch. You have the ability to prioritize (you don't focus on illustrations if the UX looks like a love child between Frankenstein and Krusty the Clown). You work smart and are ready to improve processes. You have enough curiosity to stay savvy about industry and UX trends. You have confidence in your ideas and the ability to communicate them clearly. You follow through—when built, your designs actually look and work like they should. You monitor products after launch and are ready to suggest improvements. You actively contribute to the UX community. You're kind of a behavioural science geek. You have personal pet projects you work on for fun in your free time. Apply Now We offer a competitive salary and benefits package and the professional advantages of a dynamic environment that supports your development and recognises your achievements."
