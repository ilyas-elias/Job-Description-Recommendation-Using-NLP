In short, we love to experiment and hope you will join in. Once you've done the research, you'll create sharp and concise reports full of actionable findings.

You have a working knowledge of qualitative and quantitative data analyses, usability testing, eye tracking, card sorting, survey evaluation, A/B and multivariate testing and heuristic evaluations. You can filter out noise to uncover actionable insights. In our experience, people who are organised, methodical and analytical are very good at this. You are an eloquent public speaker and an accomplished report-writer. You are an empathic human being with interest in psychology, anthropology, human-computer interaction, cognitive science and business. You have experience in the fintech industry. You have service design experience. You've been a designer yourself (or have some design experience). We find that it really helps when working with designers. You are a 'best practice junkie' and have a treasure trove of usability research around the best design pattern to use. You're kind of a behavioural science geek."
