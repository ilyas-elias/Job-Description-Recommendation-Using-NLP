        "Job_Descriptions": "The Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS) is the national flagship programme for genomic sciences in Singapore. The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) is the parent funding body for the GIS and has a long-term commitment to create a world-class infrastructure. As one of the premier genomic centres, the GIS integrates genetics, genomics and cell biology to gain fundamental, translational and clinical insights into human diseases and health (https://www.a-star.edu.sg/gis/). The GIS invites applications for outstanding Principal Investigators at the mid-career or senior level. We are seeking highly motivated individuals to develop their independent research programmes in the following domains: Precision Medicine and Population Genomics (Germline): Elucidating the role of human genes in the pathology of human diseases, leading to the long-term goal of translating genomic findings into predictive medicine to improve Singapore healthcare. Candidates should have a relevant PhD / postdoctoral training in one of the following areas; genetic association studies, statistical genetics, genetic epidemiology, a previous track record in the isolation of disease genes, and/or functional genomics. Precision Medicine and Population Genomics (Somatic): Application of functional genomics, clinical genomics, and computational biology approaches to understand the origins, evolution, and progression of cancer. Collaborating with oncologists, we employ genomics and multi-omics technologies to understand cancer predisposition, and to map the course of disease progression in the clinical setting for informing the clinical decision-making process to improve treatment outcomes. Leveraging on functional genomic tools, we seek to interrogate the function of disease-causing genes to enable target discovery that can fuel the design of novel treatment modalities to inhibit disease progression. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to, cancer genomics, cancer vaccines, cancer microbiome, cancer immunology, and artificial intelligence models of cancer. Spatial and Single Cell Systems : Development of cutting-edge, high-resolution, multi-analyte omics technologies, algorithms and platforms to transform cell and tissue biology, disrupt omics research and pathology markets, and drive clinical translation. We are looking for a new faculty who can synergise with existing programmes in cancer, neuroscience and other areas to drive spatial and single cell technology development, early adoption, clinical applications and commercialisation. This call is open to technologists as well as cell, organismal and computational biologists. Our recruits will benefit from unique spatial and single cell platforms, a vibrant and open-minded atmosphere, colleagues with deep domain expertise, and a network of local and international collaborators, scientific consortia and industry partners. Epigenetic and Epitranscriptomic Regulation: Development of new technologies to understand the functions of epigenetics and epitranscriptomics in human health. In close collaboration with other domains, we aim to understand the roles of DNA and RNA modifications in a genome-scale level across different human populations and diseases, with the final goal of being able to target these modifications for disease treatment. We are looking for highly motivated individuals to develop their independent research programme. These include early career independent fellows, as well as PIs at the mid-career or senior level. Genome Architechture: Develop new technologies to analyse genome structure and function for non-model organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals. We are looking for scientific leaders in the development of computational and experimental technologies for de novo genome assembly, genome structure analysis and metagenomics, as well as domain experts in large-scale bacterial, fungal and plant genomics for medical, biodiversity and biotechnology applications. Candidates with established track records in microbiome studies, fungal genomics, high-throughput microbial genomic assays, and plant genome biology are highly desirable. Genome Design: Build technologies to engineer DNA or RNA (including viral/non-viral delivery, gene therapy, modified DNA/RNA, CRISPR-Cas, DNAzymes/ribozymes, and other editing systems). Candidates with established track record in nucleic acid therapeutics development, genomics technologies development, translation into clinical trials, and/or biotech companies are highly desirable. Job Requirements Qualified candidates should have a PhD in the biological, genomic or computational sciences, and a demonstrated ability to conduct cutting-edge research with a strong record of peer-reviewed publications, intellectual property creation, and external funding. You must be comfortable working in a dynamic research organisation and be able to balance multiple responsibilities. Strong communication skills and a willingness to work collaboratively in a multidisciplinary environment are critical for success. The successful candidate will drive an expansion into the indicated research areas and complement and synergise with ongoing research programmes at the GIS.

        "Job_Descriptions": "Senior Associate, Product Designer (WD26850) Business Function As the leading bank in Asia, DBS Consumer Banking Group is in a unique position to help our customers realise their dreams and ambitions. As a market leader in the consumer banking business, DBS has a full spectrum of products and services, including deposits, investments, insurance, mortgages, credit cards and personal loans, to help our customers realise their dreams and aspirations at every life stage. Our financial solutions are not only the best in the business – they were made just right for you. Responsibilities You'll spend time with our wonderful research team. Together you'll translate user insights into tangible designs that address customer needs while meeting the business goals of the project. More often than not, You'll check on the latest relevant data, including product performance or revenue models, to get a better understanding of the problem and meet the stakeholders to redefine the problem statement. Once you know where you're going, it's time to tackle the behemoth tech systems and legal restrictions of a bank. Product manager will become your best friend. You'll message the tech lead more than your parents. You'll get a crash course in finance law. You will work closely with these buddies to help identify and prioritise their near and long term goals, and work out a product roadmap and strategy with them. We want to hire people who have opinions, believe in their ideas and are willing to fight for them. But we also want people who can recognise when a better argument or solution is put before them. All of us participate in user testing, and so will you. Produce work you are proud of. This is where your craft comes in. Depending on the demands of the project, you should be familiar with creating user journey maps, service design blueprints, work on information architecture, produce wireframes and clickable prototypes for user validation sessions. We do respect the privacy of people with headphones-on, trying to avoid eye contact. So you'll have the time to focus on your stuff. Like we said, producing good work is not good enough if it doesn't get built. You will meet stakeholders from different departments and articulate your ideas so clearly that you'll become an honorary Toastmaster. Before you know it, it will be Friday and time for team dinner, drinks or Creative Day (we do something fun and creative together once a month). Requirements We have senior and junior positions. Let us know what kind of role you're looking for when you apply. You can brainstorm the next big thing one moment and still tweak pixels right before launch. You have the ability to prioritise (you don't focus on illustrations if the UX looks like a love child between Frankenstein and Krusty the Clown). You work smart and are ready to improve processes. You have enough curiosity to stay savvy about industry and UX trends. You have confidence in your ideas and the ability to communicate them clearly. You follow through—when built, your designs actually look and work like they should. You monitor products after launch and are ready to suggest improvements. You have a burning desire to make things better and don’t accept non-answers like “that’s just the way it has always been”. Bonus points You actively contribute to the UX community. You're kind of a behavioural science geek. You have personal pet projects you work on for fun in your free time. Your team and career You will be working closely with stakeholders and fellow designers within DBS Institutional Banking Group (IBG). The things you design will meet the needs of a range of customers from small sole-proprietorships to large global institutions with different departments and army of staff of varying levels with different needs. This role is reporting to the Head of Design for IBG, who in turn reports to DBS Chief Design Officer. Depending on your career aspirations, you can continue to grow by pursuing perfection in your craft as an individual contributor or take on managerial responsibilities as a design manager. Apply Now​ We offer a competitive salary and benefits package and the professional advantages of a dynamic environment that supports your development and recognises your achievements."
