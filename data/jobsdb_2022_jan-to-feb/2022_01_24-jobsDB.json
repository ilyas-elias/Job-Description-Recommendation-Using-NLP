Our employees work together to reach better outcomes, favoring the strongest idea over the strongest individual. We put people first and demonstrate care and compassion for our community and each other. Because what we do matters - to us as valued professionals and to the millions of people and institutions who rely on us to help them build more secure and prosperous futures. What you will be responsible for: About MFS: In 1924 MFS Investment Management established the first mutual fund in the United States. Today, MFS offers a wide range of products and services to investors, including more than 70 mutual funds, fixed and variable annuities, separately managed accounts, and retirement plans to retail customers, institutional investors, and insurance offerings.

International Equity Research Analyst Summer Intern As a member of our 80 person equity research department, you will be solely responsible for fundamental research on one particular global industry with the objective of developing specific company and stock recommendations for the portfolios managed by MFS. A summer analyst is expected to work independently in the structuring, development and communications of investment recommendations. Our analysts draw upon a wide variety of information sources such as company literature, business publications and Wall Street research. The emphasis; however, is on original industry and company research including attendance at conferences and field trips to company facilities and interviews with corporate management at all levels. Analysts are expected to perform as the \"in-house\" expert on their particular area(s) of concentration. A summer analyst is given responsibility for one global industry in Asia (usually 4 -5 companies). Industry assignments are based on the needs of the firm. There is a short, 3 day, training program at the start of the internship to reinforce some of the basic skills necessary to do the job. Following that you will work with a senior analyst who provides guidance and assistance in the development of analytical and valuation techniques. The goal of this relationship is to enable the investment intern to effectively generate and communicate investment recommendations. The internship is generally 10 weeks in duration (June - August). This position will be located in Singapore. In the long-term, the MFS analyst path has a great deal of flexibility in career options. Analysts with a good track record and solid performance have three career options available: a long-term analyst that moves across various sectors a dedicated sector analyst, managing a sector and sector money become a diversified fund manager Qualifications: Singapore internship is based in Singapore, local work authorization preferred #LI-HYBRID What we offer: At MFS, we view our employees as family - and like you, we want our family happy and healthy. That's why we provide competitive benefits programs and family-friendly policies which support the work-life balance needs of our employees.
