You will also spend a good chunk of your time measuring and reporting on results, followed by championing UX enhancements based on data analysis. Our leadership team takes user experience very seriously. That means we don't measure our work using only soft metrics (such as how well the user testing went), but also by its business impact (such as adoption, growth, revenue, retention and margins). Even with a team as large as ours (the larger UX team comprises 100+ people from 20 different countries), you will need to engage freelancers and agencies from time to time.

For example, you are not afraid of standing up to push back on decisions if it will result in a bad experience for customers and employees. You have experience in digital methods, information architecture, interaction design, service design and Scrum/Agile management. Executive Maturity & Stakeholder Mgmt You can talk confidently and clearly about design at various levels in the organisation and build lasting relationships with our stakeholders. People Mgmt & Growth You are genuinely interested in human behaviour, care about each individual and know how to make your team function, so that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Vision You have a clear vision for each product and project you work on-one profound idea. You don't let it get diluted, and you are able to communicate and execute it. You are passionate and curious about the cultural and socio-economic changes many tech, business companies are going through and the creative opportunities they present. Motivation / Perseverance / Grit You persevere to see your long-term vision through. You don't give up at the first hurdle because sometimes change takes time. You identify and focus on the aspects that will make a difference / drive outcomes. Bonus Points You have experience working in Asia. You have experience running enterprise level projects. You are good at rapid prototyping and are comfortable with methodologies like whiteboard facilitation (visual note-taking, ideation, quick sketching & lo-fi wire framing). Your Team and Career The Enterprise design unit within group design looks at making employees' journeys joyful. This team will be working on improving internal tools at an enterprise level across service units. This is a leadership role, based in Singapore. Depending on your experience, you will manage designers to deliver one of our high-priority projects or manage all UX projects within one of our larger business units.

        "Job_Descriptions": "What You'll Do Your mission is to help our customers navigate the Digitalisation journey; addressing customers’ business needs and challenges through the adoption of Cisco’s product and solution offerings. As a Systems Engineer, you will partner with our Account Executives in a pre-sales technical role, showcasing Cisco products and solutions. You will conduct technical presentations, provide architecture design guidance, set up Proof-of-Concept demonstrations, and explain how product features and solutions benefit our customers and meet their needs. You will predominantly work with customers in the Public Sector segment. You will work with a wide variety of technologies and will therefore need strong collaborative and consultative skills and capacities to effectively showcase Cisco products and solutions, demonstrate technical solutions and capabilities, conduct Proof-of-Concept (PoC) tests. You will need eye for business to translate technical features and functionalities of a Cisco solution to map to customer’s business outcomes and benefits To sharpen your technical skills, you will be assigned as a specialist member to one of the System Engineering Virtual Teams. You are expected to participate actively in the Virtual Team events and activities and collaborate with the broader members of Cisco’s Systems Engineering team. Who You'll Work with The Systems Engineering team comprises many dedicated, hardworking and customer-centric engineers and architects who love to provide customers with an amazing experience with Cisco’s product and solution offerings. We play different roles in the areas of account pre-sales management, technology deep dive, partner advocacy and engineering leadership. We place emphasis on individual development and relevancy in the market place, and we are strong advocates of Cisco’s own certification programs. We are constantly on the look-out for new skills to add to our team’s capability. Who You Are You have a start-up mentality to deliver solutions that drive business success for Cisco. Excellent written and oral communication skills are necessary to collaborate effectively with Cisco team members, partners and customers. In addition to technical capability and competency, you must possess the ability to learn quickly and stay ahead of on networking trends. Required Knowledge and Experience 4 to 6 years of Pre-sales experience in the areas of Data Centre Networking, Enterprise Networking, Software-Defined Networks and Cyber-Security Hands-on working knowledge of Routers, Switches, Firewalls Familiarity with virtualisation platforms such as vSphere ESXi, HyperV, KVM, etc. Good knowledge of Cloud platforms, such as AWS, Azure An active CCNP / CCIE certification is preferred Good inter-personal skills Strong problem-solving and analytical skills Why Cisco At Cisco. we celebrate the creativity and diversity that fuels our innovation. We are dreamers and we are doers. We bring our different talents to work and forge a strong team to make a difference. We connect everything: people, processes, data, and things. We innovate everywhere, taking bold risks to shape the technologies that give us smart cities, smart connected offices, mobile banking, etc. We are not afraid to change the way the world works, lives, plays and learns. We are the “Bridge to Possible” Why Cisco WE ARE CISCO #WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it. We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box! But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.) Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take the difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward."
