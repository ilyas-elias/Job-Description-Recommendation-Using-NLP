        "Job_Descriptions": "Vice President APAC Commodities Business Unit Manager APAC Commodities Business Unit Managers responsibilities include facilitating strategic initiatives within the Commodities business while ensuring a robust control environment is maintained. As such this role not only requires a strong business sense but also the ability to identify and mitigate operational risks for the Commodities business by working with support functions such as Legal, Risk, Finance, Operations, Technology and Compliance. Responsibilities: This role is part of the Business Unit Management team covering APAC Commodities and is closely tied to the front line business involving a variety of day-to-day queries, investigations and ongoing projects across the full range of areas that impact the business. Examples are supporting the APAC Commodities head by overseeing sales production & trading issues, monitoring revenues and costs, stepping in when issues are not being resolved and there is a risk to the business operations, supporting the business to manage their headcount, identifying risk & control gaps and driving closure of the same and helping the business to get organized around delivering its strategic goals and new business initiatives including staying abreast of external market developments and assessing impacts to our business. This is very much a 'spider in the web' role which interacts with almost all functional areas that deal with the sales & trading desks, including other sales & trading desks within the firm. The candidate should be able to appropriately assess risk when business decisions are made, demonstrating particular consideration for the firm's reputation and safeguarding Citigroup, its clients and assets, by driving compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, adhering to Policy, applying sound ethical judgment regarding personal behavior, conduct and business practices, and escalating, managing and reporting control issues with transparency.

It is crucial that the candidate is able to 1) understand the core problem that needs to be solved, 2) understand why that problem is relevant and important, and 3) assess where this issue might be affecting others across the team and organization. This role requires an ability to juggle multiple competing deadlines, meet daily requirements as well as progressing longer-term deliveries within stated timelines. It is therefore crucial for the candidate to be able to work well under pressure, possess strong task-management skills and to be able to adapt quickly to changing priorities. Business managers are often the hub of communication tying various parts of the organization together to solve problems. The candidate should demonstrate clear and concise written and verbal communication skills. Communication is particularly important in this role given its many touchpoints and proximity to the day-to-day running of the sales & trading desks. As part of the Business Unit Management team, there will also be opportunities to participate in cross-business projects and initiatives allowing the candidate to work with members of the wider team and other parts of the firm. Qualifications: 8 - 10 years of banking or relevant experience Knowledge of the financial services industry and technology, Commodities experience is preferred Previous experience in managing complex projects and processes Proven ability to work in high-pressure environments Experience in developing and maintaining effective work relationships Skills/Competencies: Strong communication skills (written and verbal) Self-starter and highly motivated with a positive mind-set towards learning Enthusiastic team player who can collaborate effectively with others to get things done.

        "Job_Descriptions": "About the Position We are hiring Production Engineers in our Hong Kong office. Jane Street production engineers are software developers who spend time both developing software and also providing high-quality support for software systems that are critical to Jane Street's trading business. Many of our production engineers are embedded in various software teams; others are in standalone teams. In both situations we work alongside software engineers with a common goal of creating and running great software systems. As a firm we are big believers in functional programming, and use OCaml as our primary development language. Production engineers play an essential role interacting with a wide variety of departments and functions at Jane Street. We solve real-time issues and make a firm-wide impact. We take ownership of the architecture and design of systems that monitor and support the firm’s trading. We also design and develop the tools that we use, and it feels great to be able to shape these tools and then enjoy the improvements. How is a Production Engineer role different from a generic Software Engineering role? As production engineers: We split our time between OCaml software development project work and a support rotation, in which we actively resolve live issues in Jane Street’s critical systems. We are curious and eager to learn about a number of different systems and how they fit together. This gives us a breadth of knowledge and opportunities to collaborate with many other dev and business teams across the firm. We spend less time in total coding (due to the support rotation), and are interrupted more often, and we enjoy adding value to Jane Street in this way.

There are currently more than 100 hotlines across the Whole of Government (WOG). The Contact Centre team in ServiceSG aims to work with agencies who own these hotlines to streamline and integrate these contact centres, especially those that provide related services. The goal is to establish a central ServiceSG contact centre that can address the queries of citizens across over 400 citizen related services, serving as a “outsourced shared service” for selected agencies.

What we are looking for We are looking for an experienced and motivated individual who can work autonomously in a fast-paced environment.

        "Job_Descriptions": "What the role is The operating environment of the Public Service is undergoing fundamental and rapid change. The issues we face are complex and multi-faceted, which impact the way the Public Service operates and organises itself. To prepare the Public Service for these changes, we have begun the journey towards Public Sector Transformation (PST). As part of the current phase of PST, ServiceSG aims to be on par with globally leading companies in our delivery of public services. A key transformation in the delivery of citizen services is to take a citizen-centric service journey approach to organising services in an integrated manner via a) a digital concierge via the LifeSG app, b) a physical concierge via an expanded network of Integrated Public Service Centres (IPSCs); and c) a national contact centre. Our aim is to transform the current citizen experience of having to navigate across different public agencies to an experience of the Public Service “knowing, understanding and interacting with me as One”. There are currently more than 100 hotlines across the Whole of Government (WOG). The Contact Centre team in ServiceSG aims to work with agencies who own these hotlines to streamline and integrate these contact centres, especially those that provide related services. The goal is to establish a central ServiceSG contact centre that can address the queries of citizens across over 400 citizen related services, serving as a “outsourced shared service” for selected agencies. The team will also support surges in contact centre call loads for key agencies during peak periods, and act as the crisis call centre in a national pandemic or crisis. Responsibilities Reporting to the Deputy Director, you will be responsible for implementing a WOG operations model with an outsourced contact centre partner to provide seamless phone services to citizens on a bundle of services that will be assigned to you. You will develop operational strategies to ensure that the contact centre accurately handles queries and proactively cross refers a range of relevant services to citizens based on their life stages. You will work with agency stakeholders to establish operational processes to ensure that citizens’ queries are followed up and closed promptly. You will work as a team to implement technology projects at the contact centre, e.g., Voice Virtual Assistants and Knowledge Management Systems to automate simple queries to raise productivity at the contact centre. What you will be working on [Specific Areas of Responsibilities] Monitor and track contact centre’s performance KPIs for the service bundle (e.g. Customer Satisfaction, Cross Referral Target) Develop a deep knowledge of the complexity and range of queries asked by citizens within the service bundle Work with partner agencies and contact centre to build and maintain a comprehensive knowledge base to enable the contact centre agents to handle queries on a wide variety of cross agency topics Develop conversation strategies and cross referral scripts, and train the agents to be effective in cross-referral Work with partner agencies to develop escalation protocols Develop and implement strategies to resolve simple queries Work with agency partners and stakeholders to implement technology such as voice virtual assistant and ensure that knowledge base is up to date. Write and disseminate quarterly e-newsletters to update partner and stakeholder agencies on the contact centre’s developments Handle procurement, contract management, finance, and other administrative duties. What we are looking for We are looking for motivated individuals who can work autonomously in a fast-paced environment. You should be comfortable with ambiguity, be action-focused, and be comfortable to explore new ideas and work them to deliver desired outcomes. [Work Experience & Competencies] An ideal candidate should possess the following: [Customer Service and Case Management]: Demonstrate care and empathy in understanding citizen’s underlying needs and going the extra mile to help, and escalating issues/feedback to relevant policy divisions as part of the close-the-loop process for policies/services implementation. You should possess the ability to communicate effectively through written and oral presentation. [Customer Experience Strategy and Engagement]: Transform service delivery through identifying and translating new technologies to new ways of delivering contact centre services which are more customer-centric and productive. Reimagine the delivery of contact centre services from a customer-centric perspective, identify improvements and redesign the operational or service recovery processes. [Thinking Clearly and Making Sound Judgements]: Strong analytical and critical thinking abilities. Able to work with ambiguity and loosely defined problem spaces and synthesise data points and ground realities to sense-make, propose and implement sound and timely solutions with stakeholders in mind. [Working Effectively with Stakeholders]: Able to work closely with other Public Service agencies to drive the service transformation initiative and achieve better coordination and integration of technology and processes. [Procurement and Contract Management]: Oversee procurement and vendor management to minimise lapses and noncompliance. Monitor execution of procurement operations for accuracy and consistency with provided requirements, and escalate issues to appropriate stakeholders to resolve issues in a timely manner.
