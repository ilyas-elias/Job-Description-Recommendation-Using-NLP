As a market leader in the consumer banking business, DBS has a full spectrum of products and services, including deposits, investments, insurance, mortgages, credit cards and personal loans, to help our customers realise their dreams and aspirations at every life stage. Our financial solutions are not only the best in the business – they were made just right for you. About the design team Hi, we are the DBS user experience design team We create digital products that deserve to be built because they solve real problems in an impactful way with empathy. How we design We go beyond numbers Every dollar means something. No one actually wants money. We want what it can give us. So we acknowledge that money is not really about money. We inject emotion into our products to go from transactional to magical. We have one profound idea Because ambiguity is the enemy of good user experience. What is our unique value proposition? Would adding another feature dilute the idea or make it stronger? What you'll be doing You will keep us on our toes. Remind us to look away from the comfort of our screens and back at the reality—where our customers live. You will keep asking, 'Why are we doing this again?'. And not be satisfied with the answer, 'If we build it, they will come.' Here's what your week might look like Not everything has to be tested. You will identify when research is required and when best practices are the way to go. And you will help us communicate that to our stakeholders. You will do the groundwork: qualitative and quantitative research. We've done some interesting stuff: diary studies, ethnography, A/B testing, and others. In short, we love to experiment and hope you will join in. Once you've done the research, you'll create sharp and concise reports full of actionable findings. Your reports will be things of beauty that will inspire your colleagues to truly start seeing through the eyes of our customers. UX is a pretty established discipline here at DBS, but we can always use help to evangelise the importance of good UX Research, and how, just because it has the word 'research' in it, it doesn't take months! Here are the experience and skills we'd love you to have You have 2 to 5 years of relevant experience. You've had hands-on involvement with an end-to-end research process. You have a working knowledge of qualitative and quantitative data analyses, usability testing, eye tracking, card sorting, survey evaluation, A/B and multivariate testing and heuristic evaluations. You can filter out noise to uncover actionable insights. In our experience, people who are organised, methodical and analytical are very good at this. You are an eloquent public speaker and an accomplished report-writer. You are an empathic human being with interest in psychology, anthropology, human-computer interaction, cognitive science and business. Bonus points You have experience in the fintech industry.
