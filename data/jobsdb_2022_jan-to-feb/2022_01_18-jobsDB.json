Daily, we are responsible for setting, monitoring, reporting and enforcing risk limits across all the trading areas. In addition, we approve new deals and products prior to trading. Whether it is an innovative exotic derivative structure, or the purchase of an entire trading business, we work closely with the front office to ensure that the risks arising from the new venture are fully understood, and adequately constrained. As a fresh graduate working alongside our experts, you will gain exposure and hone your expertise in market risk. Utilising your strong analytical skills you will be involved in the approval of new products, businesses and trading strategies.
