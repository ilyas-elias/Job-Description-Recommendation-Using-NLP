But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London in 2004 and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. In 2013 Deliveroo was launched. Fast forward to 2020 and we operate in 11 markets with over 60,000 riders who deliver orders from 60,000 restaurants in over 500 cities worldwide. We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it. We’re a technology driven company at the forefront of the most rapidly expanding industry in the world, so come and join us for the ride. What you'll be doing: This is an ideal role for someone who has some sales experience, who's looking for their first step towards working in Account Management. You'll be part of the new restaurant experience team, onboarding new restaurants on to the Deliveroo platform.

We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them. There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-up’s around."

        "Job_Descriptions": "Unlocking Stripe’s long-term potential As we build financial infrastructure for the internet, Stripe operates within a context of increasingly complex and dynamic ecosystems, and against a frontier of ambiguous and unpredictable macro change. To help Stripe navigate uncharted waters and build an enduring, valuable business, we’re building a new type of Strategy team. Corporate Strategy is a small, highly leveraged team that develops informed positions on big questions that matter most to our long-term value and influence downstream key strategic decisions. Whether it’s evaluating net-new opportunity areas, helping frame existential threats, or finding more effective ways to position ourselves to unlock value in our existing business, we approach problems with rigor, nuance, and intellectual humility. This is not your typical corporate strategy team; we don’t run the company planning processes, and we’re not “internal consultants”. While we report into Stripe’s President/Co-founder and partner closely with the leadership team, we’re interested in developing strategy work that has real teeth: strategy that is practical and connected with the rest of the company, not off in the clouds. We take a multidisciplinary approach, emphasizing holistic understanding of problems and deploying product management skill sets in addition to traditional business analysis-backed approaches. If you’re excited to help build a new model for strategy work, we want to hear from you. As Part Of The Team You Might Help Stripe decide where to deploy its resources to maximize long-term strategic value Tackle hard, ambiguous questions with rigor and independence, owning projects from problem definition to final recommendation Clearly define the opportunity and risk of Stripe’s current and future product, customer, and geographic footprint, helping us to spot trends with impact on Stripe’s overall strategy Work with teams across the company to influence their direction Evaluate white space business, product, and partnership opportunities in adjacent markets Drive strategic decisions, crisply framing a problem space, potential paths and tradeoffs, enabling Stripe to move quickly Work with Stripe’s leadership team to ensure the company is positioned to execute on its strategy in the near- and long-term Build thought leadership on the future state of the industry (e.g., the future of money movement) and potential impact to Stripe’s overall strategy Help inspire an internal community of strategy across the company You Might Be a Fit If You excel at hypothesis-driven problem solving and bringing structure to quantitative and qualitative insights You are able to look at problems from novel perspectives and distill clarifying insights that connect with wide audiences You are eager to have a high degree of ownership, directly framing and influencing Stripe’s most strategic decisions You get a kick out of digging deep into the data, thinking from first principles, and delivering the best results You have a proven track record for working well across teams and with external partners to solve hard problems You are low ego and have a knack for working well with a wide range of people You understand markets, competition, and how to leverage core competencies to create defensible strategies You have a passion for technology and an understanding of software and business technology markets, trends, and dynamics You have experience taking holistic ownership of problems, as a PM or founder You have experience in strategy consulting, investing, or a comparable role in high growth tech companies You have a unique perspective or experience that will complement the existing team You rolled your eyes just a little bit when you heard “corporate strategy” Nice To Have (or Excited To Learn) CS background or affinities Experience in a high growth technology company Experience in Corporate Strategy or Corporate Development (M&A) Experience in Product Management Experience in the payments or fintech space “Nice to have” really means “nice to have”. It’s completely possible that you don’t have any of these and are still a great fit for the team. ()"

        "Job_Descriptions": "Senior Associate, Product Designer, Consumer Banking Group About the design team Hi, we are the DBS user experience design team We create digital products that deserve to be built because they solve real problems in an impactful way with empathy. How we design We go beyond numbers Every dollar means something. No one actually wants money. We want what it can give us. So we acknowledge that money is not really about money. We inject emotion into our products to go from transactional to magical. We have one profound idea Because ambiguity is the enemy of good user experience. What is our unique value proposition? Would adding another feature dilute the idea or make it stronger? What you'll be doing You'll spend most of your time trying to simplify very complex products and ideas. It may be an uphill battle, but it's worth it. If you succeed, your designs will enable thousands of people to serve millions of our customers better. We say that, if you can work in a bank, you can work anywhere. Don't worry, we're a nice bunch of people. Around here, we go out of our way to help one another. You'll spend time with our wonderful research team. Together you'll try to understand the business goals of your project and, more often than not, meet the stakeholders to redefine the problem statement. Once you know where you're going, it's time to tackle the behemoth tech systems and legal restrictions of a bank. Your product manager will become your best friend. You'll message the tech lead more than your parents. You'll get a crash course in finance law. We do respect the privacy of people with headphones-on, trying to avoid eye contact. So you'll have the time to actually produce work you're proud of. We want to hire people who have opinions, believe in their ideas and are willing to fight for them. But we also want people who can recognize when a better argument or solution is put before them. All of us participate in user testing, and so will you. Like we said, producing good work is not good enough if it doesn't get built. We love you, Dribble/Behance. It's not you, it's us. You will meet stakeholders from different departments and articulate your ideas so clearly that you'll become an honorary Toastmaster. To prepare for those meetings you'll need to check the latest relevant data. Before you know it, it will be Friday and time for team dinner, drinks or Creative Day (we do something fun and creative together once a month). Your team and career: You will be part of the DBS enterprise design team. The enterprise design team is redefining what great internal tools look like: working on a collaborative platform to enable bankers, credit risk managers and credit controllers to manage corporate loans digitally. Behind the scenes, the team understands how important it is for a proper design process and system to be in place before great things can happen. Experience You're an end-to-end designer: you can turn high-level requirements into well-posed problem statements, wireframes, prototypes or Powerpoints for the management teams. You can talk confidently and clearly about design and build lasting relationships with our stakeholders. And you're not afraid to improvise-to think on your feet-when required. You can brainstorm the next big thing one moment and still tweak pixels right before launch. You have the ability to prioritize (you don't focus on illustrations if the UX looks like a love child between Frankenstein and Krusty the Clown). You work smart and are ready to improve processes. You have enough curiosity to stay savvy about industry and UX trends. You have confidence in your ideas and the ability to communicate them clearly. You follow through-when built, your designs actually look and work like they should. You monitor products after launch and are ready to suggest improvements. You actively contribute to the UX community. You're kind of a behavioural science geek. You have personal pet projects you work on for fun in your free time. Apply Now We offer a competitive salary and benefits package and the professional advantages of a dynamic environment that supports your development and recognizes your achievements"

        "Job_Descriptions": "Product Designer, Enterprise, Group Design Your team and career You will be part of the DBS enterprise design team. The enterprise design team is redefining what great internal tools look like: working on a collaborative platform to enable bankers, credit risk managers and credit controllers to manage corporate loans digitally. Behind the scenes, the team understands how important it is for a proper design process and system to be in place before great things can happen. What you'll be doing You'll spend most of your time trying to simplify very complex products and ideas. It may be an uphill battle, but it's worth it. If you succeed, your designs will enable thousands of people to serve millions of our customers better. We say that, if you can work in a bank, you can work anywhere. Don't worry, we're a nice bunch of people. Around here, we go out of our way to help one another. Here's what your week might look like You'll spend time with our wonderful research team. Together you'll try to understand the business goals of your project and, more often than not, meet the stakeholders to redefine the problem statement. Once you know where you're going, it's time to tackle the behemoth tech systems and legal restrictions of a bank. Your product manager will become your best friend. You'll message the tech lead more than your parents. You'll get a crash course in finance law. We do respect the privacy of people with headphones-on, trying to avoid eye contact. So you'll have the time to actually produce work you're proud of. We want to hire people who have opinions, believe in their ideas and are willing to fight for them. But we also want people who can recognise when a better argument or solution is put before them. All of us participate in user testing, and so will you. Like we said, producing good work is not good enough if it doesn't get built. We love you, Dribble/Behance. It's not you, it's us. You will meet stakeholders from different departments and articulate your ideas so clearly that you'll become an honorary Toastmaster. To prepare for those meetings you'll need to check the latest relevant data. Before you know it, it will be Friday and time for team dinner, drinks or Creative Day (we do something fun and creative together once a month). Here are the experience and skills we'd love you to have You're an end-to-end designer: you can turn high-level requirements into well-posed problem statements, wireframes, prototypes or Powerpoints for the management teams. You can talk confidently and clearly about design and build lasting relationships with our stakeholders. And you're not afraid to improvise-to think on your feet-when required. You can brainstorm the next big thing one moment and still tweak pixels right before launch. You have the ability to prioritise (you don't focus on illustrations if the UX looks like a love child between Frankenstein and Krusty the Clown). You work smart and are ready to improve processes. You have enough curiosity to stay savvy about industry and UX trends. You have confidence in your ideas and the ability to communicate them clearly. You follow through-when built, your designs actually look and work like they should. You monitor products after launch and are ready to suggest improvements. Bonus points You actively contribute to the UX community. You're kind of a behavioural science geek. You have personal pet projects you work on for fun in your free time. You have experience with Agile methodology and financial products in Treasury domain is ideal Apply Now We offer a competitive salary and benefits package and the professional advantages of a dynamic environment that supports your development and recognizes your achievements"
