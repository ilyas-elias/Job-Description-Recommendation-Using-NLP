        "Job_Descriptions": "The role We are looking for an ambitious and success-driven Business Development Executive, with experience in consistently meeting and exceeding sales targets. You will be working on the frontline of our commercial team, finding opportunities to sell our industry leading anti-money laundering software. As the owner of the first stage of the sales process you will require fantastic communication skills and a high level of professionalism. Ultimately you will be responsible for the critical step of engaging and booking meetings with world leading businesses. You'll be working in an extremely fast paced environment with the expectation to create your own work, and as such will require a hungry and motivated attitude. We are looking for someone based in Singapore to work in a hybrid work from home/office based role as local regulations allow. About us Since launching in 2014, we have been on a mission to neutralize the risk of money laundering, terrorist financing, corruption, and other financial crime on a global scale. In that time, we have raised over $88m in funding, have four global hubs located in New York, London, Singapore and Cluj-Napoca and are backed by Ontario Teachers’, Index Ventures and Balderton Capital. We aim to grow to over 350 employees in the next 12 months, as we continue to fight the good fight against financial crime and help make compliance less painful for our client base of over 500 enterprises across 75 different countries. We're leveraging game-changing tech to help us on our mission as the financial industry’s leading source of AI-driven financial crime risk data and detection technology. No fight against crime is complete without the right values, and we take ours very seriously! Focus on the Team - We're Collaborative, Human, and Humble Kaizen - We're Curious, Proactive and Agile Deliver Results - We're Tenacious, Accountable and Focused We can only defeat financial crime if we have the right people with the right values in place to do so, and we're committed to investing in passionate people who are experts in their field. Our culture and working environment is second to none - Don't believe us? See what our employees have to say on Glassdoor. Responsibilities Planning & Research: You will be provided with a territory and named accounts, however it will be your responsibility to maintain this list with up-to date and relevant account information. Most importantly you will have to be strategic in managing and planning your time and activities. You will have full control of planning your approach but it should be detailed in how you spend your time and correlate strongly with the expectations surrounding hitting your targets. All plans should be in a review cycle where we analyse their success and continuously refine, for ongoing improvement. Prospecting: You will be expected to generate leads and meetings on a daily basis. In this role the work doesn’t just come to you, your job will be to leverage our content, technology and industry experience in order to book quality meetings. You will need to engage with senior decision makers from within the biggest and most ambitious companies worldwide. You should deliver tailored and impactful verbal or written messages in order to educate them on our value proposition, which will ultimately secure meetings and qualify opportunities. You should be confident in using a variety of prospecting methods including but not limited to; Phonecalls, email, social media, industry events & video. Team Contribution: This is a role with independent targets, however you will be required to work strongly in a team. First and foremost you will be working closely with your AE, who you will be booking meetings for, therefore must be able to effectively communicate your own plans whilst following their advice and instructions. Finally the commercial team at CA are extremely team orientated, therefore we often come together to share our experiences and learnings, as a valued member of the team you will be required to communicate your opinions and share stories to receive feedback of your own. Learning & Continuous Improvement: You will be working in a niche market that is quite complex in nature. You will have the support of an experienced team and numerous amounts of training materials. However in order to excel in this role you will be required to commit to self-learning and continuous training. Areas of industry learning will cover product knowledge, competitor knowledge and a deep understanding of the market and personas you will be prospecting in to. This also extends outside of the industry as you will be expected to continuously improve your ever-expanding sales skills. To help with this you will receive an annual personal training budget and paid training days. The Ideal Candidate We’re looking for an ambitious and highly motivated individual that doesn’t take themselves too seriously, to join our team of high achievers. You should be: An all encompassing communicator: In this role the majority of your responsibilities revolve around some form of communication, be that external or internal. You must have fantastic spoken and written communication, as well as an ability to tailor your communication style to align with a variety of ages, backgrounds and personalities. Fiercely competitive, yet gracious in defeat: You should strive to be the best or No.1, if you don’t achieve that you should demonstrate an ability to learn from your experiences, in order to do better next time. You should be hungry to smash your set targets and not shy away from a challenge. A thirst for knowledge and improvement : You should be driven to improve your skills and expand your knowledge. You should be viewing this role as a stepping stone in your SAAS sales career. You’ll be working for an ever-expanding company where given the right attitude and results your career can progress extremely fast. An entrepreneurial spirit: You will need to have a keen commercial instinct in order to seek out opportunities and prioritise your time most effectively. 12 months B2B SAAS experience would be ideal, however outside of that the right candidate must be able to demonstrate natural sales acumen and past experience of smashing targets. Be an ‘independent’ team player: Given the autonomous nature of this role, you will be required to work independently, both thinking and standing on your own two feet. However, we pride ourselves on having a sales team lacking in selfish behaviour, instead creating an environment of unity and camaraderie. Therefore, those who excel in this role and business are those just as competent working individually as they are amongst an amazing high-spirited team.

Variety and challenge will be part of your daily routines. Why should you join Philips Domestic Appliances? Philips’ Domestic Appliances business is a global leader with EUR 2.3 billion in sales in 2019 in kitchen appliances, coffee, garment care and home care appliances, with successful products such as the Airfryer, Perfect Care Steam Generators, Automatic Coffee Machines with LatteGo and SpeedPro Max Aqua vacuum cleaner, and many more that are used by millions of people every day across the world. In January 2020, Philips announced that it would be considering new ownership options for Domestic Appliances, as it is not a strategic fit for the company’s future as a health technology leader, and committed to finding the right home for the business to ensure that it is set up for continued success serving customers, leveraging the Philips brand and driving growth across the markets that it serves. In its 128-year history as a leading innovator, Philips has had to reinvent itself a number of times to remain competitive. This has involved several high-profile divestments, resulting in the company’s successful track record in managing complex change of this scale.  Such transformations offer unique opportunities for employees to ‘make their mark’ and gain expertise in a specific and dynamic environment - those who can deliver results while navigating and contributing to changes will gain unique skills and perspective that will prove valuable for the rest of their careers."
