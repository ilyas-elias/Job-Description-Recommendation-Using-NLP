Has experience supporting the business on decision points such as Pricing Strategy, Demand Forecasting etc Has Advanced Business / Financial spreadsheet modelling experience Our client is an established and renowned commodity MNC that is a global leader in its field. Its office is based in town. This is a perm role as a Sales & Commercial Analyst. Key functions: General Delivery of research, numerical analyses and valuation work in relation to Business Intelligence to Financial Results to better inform and influence decisions around how the goods are sold. Examples of these decision points are Pricing Strategy, Customer Prioritisation, Viewing/Product mix Optimisation, and Demand Forecasting. Working closely with Technology and Business Intelligence department stakeholders to create an analytical sandbox that allows the Commercial Department to blend immutable information from the data warehouse and user-created queries to execute delivery of ad-hoc analysis – to better inform the Sales team with the objective of achieving more accurate sales forecasting and sell-out rates. Pricing Strategy For each lot of product being put on auction, the opening price being set is an important crucial lever for value optimisation as well as keeping auction bidding efficient. You will maintain/improve the structure of a pricing model for regular/third-party rough diamond purchases with the express aim of improving sell-out, bidding interest, competitive bidding and ultimately higher achieved prices/margins for the offered goods. Responsible for 100% accuracy of loaded data for pricing model and associated output submissions to be posted on the Auction Bid platform. Demand Forecasting Assume shared responsibility for chairing the Demand Forecasting forum where the Commercial Department will make fundamental recommendations based on the outputs of an in-house developed analysis model to be able to support the Purchase Order submission on the following desired outcomes: 1. Processing all related data (e.g Sales Opportunities data/Sales data etc) to be able to accurately predict the volume of goods demanded by customers in future sales cycles. 2. Making successful recommendations on purchasing goods that will be sold profitably in future sales cycles. 3. Reacting timeously to any known supply issues by rebalancing demand into the most suitable, appropriate product segments to still achieve desired Budget Sales commitments. Viewing Optimisation Auction Sales essentially sells rough diamonds through 10 sales cycles per year, with the majority of goods being physically shipped to our main 4 global sales offices for viewings by customers prior to bidding, on a monthly basis. For customers to gain confidence to bid, the right product mix must be sent to the various offices for timeous viewing, depending on the historical demand and bidding success rates. You will assist the ongoing development of an analytical model which ensures that, with the finite number of viewing days available for each lot, those viewing days are best dedicated to the locations and customers most likely to support maximising gross profit generation. This is done by analysing customer bases by location and bidding tendencies and successful historical conversion rates. Customer Prioritisation Further improve the in-house analysis model using key critical customer data to generate outputs for effective Customer Segmentation and Tranche structuring. To facilitate regular Customer Prioritisation review forums with key stakeholders (Commercial Manager/Head of Sales function/Production/Logistics etc) to agree on the listing, the consequences and timeous application. Skills & Personalities/Experience/Qualifications Degree in Commerce, Economics, Business, or similar disciplines with a focus on data analytics and insights, with around 2 to 4 years of relevant commercial/financial analysis experience. Has some relevant experience supporting business on decision points such as Pricing Strategy, Demand Forecasting etc. Also open to financial /FP&A analyst candidates with good commercial acumen. Professional qualification (ACA, CIMA, ACCA, CFA) or eligibility for above qualifications would be an advantage but not a must Advanced Business / Financial spreadsheet modelling experience is required Experience in using quantitative techniques and concepts such as Cost-Benefit, Linear Regression, Supply-demand curves etc is useful but this is not a must Experience in the creation of formal written research reports High proficiency in MS Excel / Powerpoint is essential Business Intelligence & Visualization tools such as Tableau, Microstrategy, Salesforce, etc is highly preferred.

We are looking for a fullstack developer who is mainly experienced in Rails but can contribute to frontend work as well. You should be comfortable independently thinking through problems, identifying edge cases, and building features from scratch. Ideally, you should be able to quickly get familiar with an Ember.js / Rails codebase, or learn fast and start contributing quickly. Who We're Looking For You should be Interested in joining an early stage startup disrupting the health tech industry Experienced in Ruby on Rails Experienced in Ember.js What we value Good communication skills are highly valued. Your code, comments and descriptions should be highly expressive, and you should be good at communicating your intent and thought process with every piece of work Design experience is a plus, otherwise design-thinking or an ability to think critically and make tough value judgements is highly regarded. Hybrids are a great fit Ability to independently source for requirements, scope out work, proactively communicate and manage one's own time Nice-to-haves Experience with mobile web and/or Cordova Experience working within healthcare or similar industries Why Work With NOVI We are an early-stage startup, so you will have a big part to play in defining the work that will be done, as well the culture. If you are excited to work on a variety of different projects and ideas that strongly impact peoples' lives, or if you are looking to maximise learning opportunities, then this might be a good fit. You'll be working on two well-crafted Ember apps – a patient-facing mobile app, as well as a web-based app for coaches. Our work has a strong emphasis on thoughtful user experience and interactions, beautiful yet practical data visualisation, and maintaining a codebase with close to zero technical debt. You can see the mobile app at https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/novify-v2/id1504900793 At present, we have helped over 1,000 patients and are scaling fast. This role will likely involve work on a couple of API integrations, as well as backend work supporting the efficiency of internal operations in order to scale, though we are flexible enough to accomodate wherever your interests lie. We are also starting to venture more deeply into machine learning and AI features. In addition, if you appreciate flexibility in working hours and location, thrive with independence, yet value good communication practices – you'll enjoy working with us. This is a chance to do work that has a meaningful and direct impact on people's health and lives – you'll be able to see first-hand how our patients become healthier as a result of using the app. If you're excited by this and having a hand in disrupting the healthcare industry, we'd love to talk to you!"
