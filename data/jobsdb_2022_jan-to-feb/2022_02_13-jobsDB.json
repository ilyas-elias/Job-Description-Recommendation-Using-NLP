        "Job_Descriptions": "Job Description We are looking to host solution-minded student to embark their internship journey with us. Here’s your chance to create a journey with us. Come join our medical start-up. EndoSiq Technology Pte Ltd is a medical start-up developing an advanced machine vision tracking system for the management of Overactive Bladder (OAB). Our goal is to design and develop a proprietary diagnostic tool to analyze real-time images of the bladder. The diagnostic tool will help pinpoint unusual muscle group activity to help in the treatment of OAB. We need passionate and flexible engineers to grow with us. EndoSiq Technology Pte Ltd is incubated by Trendlines Medical Singapore Pte Ltd. Project Name: Deep-Learning architecture development involving 2D and 1D vascular datasets such as specklegram / photoplethysmogram biosignals for polymorphic determination in cardiometabolic diseases Background: Worldwide, a third of adults suffer from some form of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) which annually contribute to the deaths of 17.7 million people globally, accounting for 31% of total deaths. In comparison, the combined annual deaths resulting from HIV/Aids, malaria, and tuberculosis combined only amount to 3.86 million. Hypertension affects at least 25% of the global adult population and is the most common cause of CVD-related deaths due to associated secondary pathologies. There is also a significant association of hypertension with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) with hypertension being twice as frequent in diabetic sufferers compared to non-diabetics. By 2050, Singapore projects that there will be 1 million sufferers of diabetes, accounting for 10% of the disease burden in Singapore. Disease prediction solely from genotyping has resulted in poor associations due to unexpected multi-nomic interactions. Scope: This project proposal seeks to apply advanced Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) algorithms on 1D/2D datasets to identify potential pleiotropic relationships in cardiometabolic diseases. We will also evaluate the predictive performance and accuracy of various AI-ML algorithms. The objective is to develop an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) architecture extracting critical features from the pulsatile morphology of 1-Dimensional PPG signals or 2D vascular videos to form an adaptive numerical model of an individual. Due difficulty in acquiring real-world biosignal datasets, novel techniques will need to be implemented to address the limited data available for training such as autonomous semi-supervised neural network designs. The project will involve 1D/2D signal processing and deep learning and will require strong knowledge in Python programming.
