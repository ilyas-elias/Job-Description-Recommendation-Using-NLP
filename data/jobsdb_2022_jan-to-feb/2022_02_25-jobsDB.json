As an early member of the team, you’ll have the ability to shape and build the next-generation data platform that will enable countless users to participate in the online digital ecosystem.

We have 7.5 billion people on Earth, of which over 1 billion cannot securely prove their identity right now. Every year, 140 million babies are born, of which 40 million go unregistered. Simply put, these people are deprived of social benefits, such as education and health, their civil rights to vote and travel; and are excluded from the economy because they cannot sign up for bank accounts, loans, welfare programs, etc. We believe this is unacceptable and needs to change. At VIDA, We are creating a frictionless digital identity system. One that fulfills the needs and expectations of our times, and is available anywhere, for everyone. Why are we solving this problem? The United Nations (UN) and World Bank ID4D initiatives aim to provide everyone on the planet with a legal identity by 2030. This deadline is just 9 years away, we are expecting a digital identity to be a legal human right by then and we at VIDA want to be pioneers in leading this change. Who are we? We are a highly driven bunch of people to solve this problem for our own reasons. Whether it is to solve for misleading doctors, or because we didn’t get access to fair ration due to corruption - Our collective goal aligns. Other things that we care about: Our mission is to enable trust, so what we do is pretty serious stuff – we work hard and we have audacious goals. We balance it through humor and making sure we have fun at work. We take our work seriously, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously. We are a startup so at times we will do things that are outside our scope. We do it to learn but we also do it because it takes a village. We believe feedback is a gift and should be given freely, constructively, and in a respectful manner. We are accountable to many stakeholders, but first and foremost, we are accountable to our mission and each other"

In short, we love to experiment and hope you will join in. - Once you've done the research, you'll create sharp and concise reports full of actionable findings. Your reports will be things of beauty that will inspire your colleagues to truly start seeing through the eyes of our customers. - UX is a pretty established discipline here at Bank, but we can always use help to evangelize the importance of good UX Research.

In our experience, people who are organized, methodical and analytical are very good at this. - You are an eloquent public speaker and an accomplished report-writer. - You are an empathic human being with interest in psychology, anthropology, human-computer interaction, cognitive science and business. Bonus points - You have experience in the fintech industry. - You've been a designer yourself (or have some design experience). We find that it really helps when working with designers.

As a Deep Learning/AI scientist, you’ll have the exciting opportunity to build out core pieces of technology to verify and validate people’s identities. You’ll be building out deep learning models in facial recognition, optical character recognition (OCR), and researching methods to protect these services against malicious actors. As an early member of the machine learning team, you’ll be expected to roll up your sleeves and own the model pipeline from end to end. Responsibilities: Design, train and deploy computer vision models to facilitate the eKYC process: facial recognition, OCR, document verification, etc Design, train and deploy models to protect users from fraud and other malicious actors Owl the full lifecycle of deploying models: from data labeling, working with engineers to design scalable APIs, to monitoring and A/B testing new model versions Build the next generation of our model training and scoring infrastructure, in close collaboration with infrastructure teams Collaborate with business, product, operations, and engineering teams to deliver impact for our customers Work independently or in a team to solve complex problem statements Requirements: An advanced degree in a quantitative field, or many years of experience working on similar problems in the industry Deep understanding of modern computer vision techniques, deep learning, and machine learning Experience developing and deploying machine learning models in production Proficient in Python, C++, Scala, or Java Familiarity with modern deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet Experience with Airflow, Spark, SQL Experience in on-device inference for machine learning models is a plus Take pride in taking ownership and driving projects to have a business impact Thrive in a fast-moving collaborative environment ABOUT VIDA What are we trying to solve? We have 7.5 billion people on Earth, of which over 1 billion cannot securely prove their identity right now. Every year, 140 million babies are born, of which 40 million go unregistered. Simply put, these people are deprived of social benefits, such as education and health, their civil rights to vote and travel; and are excluded from the economy because they cannot sign up for bank accounts, loans, welfare programs, etc. We believe this is unacceptable and needs to change. At VIDA, We are creating a frictionless digital identity system. One that fulfills the needs and expectations of our times, and is available anywhere, for everyone. Why are we solving this problem? The United Nations (UN) and World Bank ID4D initiatives aim to provide everyone on the planet with a legal identity by 2030. This deadline is just 9 years away, we are expecting a digital identity to be a legal human right by then and we at VIDA want to be pioneers in leading this change. Who are we? We are a highly driven bunch of people to solve this problem for our own reasons. Whether it is to solve for misleading doctors, or because we didn’t get access to fair ration due to corruption - Our collective goal aligns. Other things that we care about: Our mission is to enable trust, so what we do is pretty serious stuff – we work hard and we have audacious goals. We balance it through humor and making sure we have fun at work. We take our work seriously, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously. We are a startup so at times we will do things that are outside our scope. We do it to learn but we also do it because it takes a village. We believe feedback is a gift and should be given freely, constructively, and in a respectful manner. We are accountable to many stakeholders, but first and foremost, we are accountable to our mission and each other"

        "Job_Descriptions": "Hogarth Worldwide is the world’s leading creative content production company. Born to make the  best work brilliantly, we combine craft, insight and technology to bring creative work to life for many of the world’s most famous brands. A Hybrid working model Once offices are fully open we will be moving to a hybrid working model, which will allow our employees to split their time between the office and other locations, something we hope will provide everyone much more flexibility to their working week. The expectation is that working life at Hogarth will involve working from the office for about 50% of the time for most people. Please speak to the Talent Acquisition team to find out more information. What does a Hybrid Account/Project Manager do at Hogarth? As part of a close knit client services team, you will play a key role in managing a well established and successful partnership with the Retail division of a highly prestigious tech client. Although based-in and primarily covering the APAC region you will also need to take a wider global view, working closely with colleagues in two other Hogarth hubs (California and the UK). This collaboration will be critical to success. Reporting into the local Account Director we are looking for someone able to flex their skills across an agency/onsite client role, requiring both classic account management skills and a strong project management capability. You will be focused on coordinating and managing project stakeholders, overseeing a sometimes diverse project delivery group including but not limited to, account and project managers, production designers and linguists. Whilst quality is always forefront, working to fast turnaround times with an awareness of the most efficient ways to deliver against KPI and budget parameters will be essential. Innovation is central to this and we are looking for someone who proactively stays abreast of the latest industry developments and is keen to explore and understand a climate of change and evolution.
